so many times have i walked on ruins the remainings of places that i loved and got used to at first i was scared each time i could feel my city my current generation collapse break into the black hole that thrives within it i could feel humanity the way i m able to feel my body after a few hundred years the pattern became obvious no longer the war and damage that would devastate me over and over again in the far past was effecting me so dominantly it s funny but i felt as if after gaining what i desired so long what i have lived for my entire life only then when i achieved immortality i started truly aging 5 world wars have passed and now they feel like a simple sickeness that would pass by every so often i could no longer evaluate the individual human as a being of its own the importance of mortals is merely the same as the importance of my skin cells they are a part of a mechanism so much more advanced a mechanism that is so dear to my fallen heart a mechanism that i have seen fall and rise so many times a mechanism that when lost all of which it had had me loosing my will to live for the first time in all of my thousands years of existence acceptance something so important a skill that has proved itself worthy dozens of times an ability that looks so easy to achieve a gift that i was n t able to aquire in all my years until now when the ashes on the ground flew into the now empty air upon humanity s fall i felt as if all of it s weight was crushing me ignorance took over and i searched years for a hope a sign of the very same patterns that i used to watch reappear every hundred years the very core of my will to exist that was now no more that i so strongly wish was if you have ever wondered if silence can drive people crazy it can i ca n t feel my legs i have walked for days just to hear the sound of gravel crushed bones crushed buildings and crushed civilizations under my steps to keep my sanity until i remembered the day in my far past the day of my rebirth i took out of my pocket a small plastic box with nine buttons and a small glass window i could n t believe this was our past i could n t believe how far we have been able to progress and yet be destroyed by our own violence i slowly dialed the number i was given exactly 1729 years ago i dropped a tear a tear that was too slow to hit the ground as i got sucked into the darkness that emerged around me a chill went through my spine as i saw my destiny rise above me i could see the white teeth under the dark cloack you have finally arrived he projected into my mind with the most chilling cold and unhuman voice i m ready to obey i answered i knew who was sitting infront of me and it was time for me to obey him after all these years of playing god even i came to it funny is n t it even by achieving immortality death is inescapable
week 18 aboard the depth reaver circa 2023 i walk about the dull gray halls the artificial gravity making my steps feel almost as if they were on land almost i glance out a window as i pass it by there s the sun and there s the moon right there and of course there s the earth i kinda miss it then again space is pretty cool it s got some brilliant views and the wifi is surprisingly good even countless miles away from the earth i can crush silver noobs on cs go i pass by dale malkowitz the head scientist on board evening dale i say what up danny he replies cordially nothin much a little bored i guess he shakes his head in disbelief i really really do n t understand how you can be bored in space well hey i say slightly defensively aside from the views it s kinda dull and empty and stuff whatever you say wittell he says not unkindly then he walks off a few moments pass and then i decide to look out the window right by me as my eyes scan the inky blackness of space again i notice something odd about the moon s surface it s slightly cracked hey malkowitz i call out you might wan na check this out he walks over to me casually probably expecting nothing what he asks what do you see i point at the moon his brow furrows huh i guess there s something up with the surface i ll have to look into tha suddenly the surface cracks a little more we glance at each other and then back at the moon and then at each other again and then back at the moon again what s going on i ask alarmed he s silent for a minute or two mouth hanging open then he calls out janice terry johnny get over here something s up with the moon the other crewmates enter unsure of what to expect as their eyes lay upon the moon s surface cracks they widen and by coincidence more cracks appear at that very moment and then more and more and more and more little bits of the moon begin to float away torn free of the rest of the surface we all stare speechless and then it happens it happens the side of the moon facing us is torn away by a human hand and we see a giant human face surprisingly i can hear my thoughts over my racing heart i ca n t help but feel as if i recognize that face from the internet suddenly the great face s lips move of course none of us can actually hear it speak because of the laws of space and whatnot however i can read its lips and it appears to be saying are you sure about that

no no no no she backed up and turned the other way the second she saw me heading towards her hey starting to walk quickly now i picked up my pace until i nearly ran into her she tried to duck behind one of the men carrying samples around the food court but instead just managed an awkward half step around him before i grabbed her shoulder she turned towards me so i could get a clear view of her face now i was sure it was her joanne her eyes lit up if only for a second before she turned back around grabbed her hands and lowered her head before once again repeating her rant of no s from earlier you can t be here not now i finally get this far and now you re here she was mumbling more to herself than to me at this point you you re real i said looking back to her eyes how do you know who i am i m real of course i m real but you can t be here now she was talking directly to me do you know what kinds of hell you put me through the amount of bullying stress and endless therapy dave i finally get rid of you and now you have to come back in my head and tear it back out from under me she slapped her head a few times as she delivered the last line what are you talking about i we were best friends true or false she asked true no false i mean we were friends but not i looked at her once more to make sure she was actually standing there you re a dream she froze at this no no i m you re a hallucination i saw you for years every waking moment from seven until twelve i looked at her shaking my head incredulous to what was happening when we fell out of that tree that one summer she smiled for just a second before frowning again and looking down but that was just a dream i woke up right after that no that actually happened i was awake i remember it exactly because that s when i still lived in australia with my parents i looked at her and began to realize something you saw me when you were awake i dreamt you while i was asleep i lived in boston when you lived in australia hold on she sat down my head hurts she paused we met every day night i corrected she looked at me and scowled every day for five years until we fell what happened after that i told you i woke up no what happened for me i don t remember anything but falling head first and then joanne i looked her straight in the eyes this time i woke up
there s a magical moment between wakefulness and sleep a moment where noise seems to reach a crescendo but everything is so calm right as you crash into the warm waves of sleep as my eyes closed the only thing i saw was the time on the tv screen in front of me faded blue numbers that read 10 34am unless your plane explodes searing heat tears through flesh and shard of metal pierce every nerve for a fraction of a fraction of a moment there is nothing but horrendous pain and then there is darkness that s when i woke up drenched in sweat eyes wide with fear and panic the first thing i noticed was the time 9 35am it had been so real it was real that was no dream it could n t have been i glance around to my fellow passengers and wonder how it happened what caused it can we stop it stop the plane i want to get off i ve been a cop for a long time that s the good news the bad i m stuck in a metal tube that i think is going to explode in less than an hour and i have to find out how without panicking anyone especially if i m wrong but what if i m right no resources no back up no escape fuck it no problem 9 36am alright there s got to be at least 300 people on board not including crew it could be mechanical and it s going up in flames no matter what and that s bad news we re too far away to do anything about that the map shows somewhere over the pacific that s really bad not like anyone would believe me i m not entirely sure i believe me my only hope is that i can find out what causes the whole thing before the whole thing happens terrorism i mean i guess it could be but that s a slim shot in the dark so what in the blue hell blows up a plane over the ocean first stop bathroom experience an explosion is enough to make you feel the urge to relieve yourself that s when i see her i stand and she s further back but she s got that look on her face the sweat the panic she saw it too the good i guess i have a partner the bad i might not be wrong 9 37am i wave to her and motion towards the washrooms you saw it she nodded did you see anything she shook her head this was n t productive there had to be something some piece of information that either of us had buried in our brains that would be useful then something clicked do you remember which way the explosion came from she tilted her head as if she was remembering yeah the heat was in front of me what the hell is going on i looked back to the passengers there were six rows between her seat and mine six rows of nine that s 54 if any math from school stuck hey did you hear me she said grabbing my arm yeah it came from in front of you it came from behind me so that means it started somewhere between us she finished which would usually annoy me but in this case it was nice to have someone pick up on it nice and quick i checked my watch 9 41am we were running out of time 9 42am does anyone stick out to you she whispered and i shook my head we could probably eliminate a few potential suspects by process of elimination a young family probably was n t going to cause a problem the elderly couple as well stuff like that as i watched i saw there were three people acting nervously one portly man checking his watch a little too frequently a younger man sweating profusely a woman glancing around with what i would describe as suspicion i pointed them out to her and she agreed so maybe we had three suspects or maybe we had three nervous flyers 9 45am seconds were ticking by and we had a very limited number of those to start as we stood there a flight attendant approached us from behind she startled both of us and that s when the woman turned and locked eyes with me then her eyes went wide and she knew that someone knew she bolted from her seat and reached for the overhead compartment that s when i slammed into her full force throwing both our bodies to the hard floor and skidding at least three rows ahead when i lifted my head i was staring down the barrel of a handgun a young man sweating profusely was holding the right end of it and i was definitely on the wrong end he was n t holding a badge though which meant things were going from bad to worse
the mountain stood still and large beneath the warrior it had not trembled in the days since the people chose him as their champion perhaps the dragon slumbers yet he thought i shall wake him soon enough he strode forward heavily in his iron raiment shining dully in the morning sun the shrouded peak drew slowly nearer as the sun climbed the sky mirroring the warrior s toil this day as the last the dragon slept silently in its lair amidst the clouds for generations the people had not seen it wake but their stories told by night and hearth fire still remained hushed in reverence of its deadly wrath legends told of it waking and the destruction that followed but that was before before the people had tamed iron and bent it to their will now they had weapons that could fight the myth that could quench the fire the warrior stopped at the edge of the cloud bank just as the sun had stopped there hours before he breathed deliberately he pulled the heavy iron axe from his belt and gripped it between strong hands a glow had appeared within the clouds the mountain rumbled i have come to wake you beast and i have come to show you the people no longer fear you the ground rolled and thundered he roared in defiance and raised his axe charging into the fog he half ran and climbed in muffled beats as his bloodlust for the dragon pounded in his ears the glow grew brighter and the ground shook violently a gout of flame split the clouds in front of the warrior and he saw his destination the rock ended in a ridge just above him and the dragons flames beat and splashed beyond without breaking stride the iron warrior crested the ridge and leapt axe raised high into a pit of dragon fire
i open my eyes in a panic sweat beading and then falling down my face i look around and the sun in shining through the maroon curtains of my studio apartment everything seems to be as i left it the afternoon before but there is a heavy unfamiliar air in the room i notice the throw cover i lazily hang to separate my twin size bed from the rest of the apartment has been ripped to the ground and that the kitchen faucet rhythmically drips against the cold steel sink i was alone last night like i always am i think no one has been here but me in over three months i m not allowed to think about it much longer as the feeling in my stomach bubbles over and pops once more as it had been doing all night slowly worsening i pinch my eyes shut knowing what s coming next and for just one moment as the pain peaks like a giant wave waiting to break i think i may just die this time and just as quickly the wave reaches the shore and i know i have a few moments of peace i open my eyes and look around i ca n t help but surrender to the weight of them after a few moments and i drift to an uneasy sleep as the tension escapes from my stomach and from the rest of my body dissipating into the small space i call home the next wave takes what remains in me and decimates it the pain blinds me numbing me to all feeling and sensation the relief never comes as i close my eyes involuntarily i finally come to and realize i had been asleep for a while i open my eyes and fighting the blinding lights and white room i see that the natural maroon lighting of my apartment has been replaced by white hospital lights beyond the thick glass walls of the room that was smaller than my apartment though i did n t think it got smaller than that stand people i have never seen before looking at papers and analyzing the rhythms of the machines i now realize i am hooked up to the men all stop and slowly turn their unexpected gazes at me as i begin to curl my sore body into a seated position only to be shocked back down by a face that made the sea of unfamiliar faces fade away the prominent cheekbones that made my mother seem so much prouder than her nature would actually allow remained strong though the rest of her seemed to be worn down by the years the same mahogany curls fell across those cheeks and down right above her shoulders though they seemed more ashen now her frail yet determined hand touching the impenetrable glass and reaching to pick me up and hold me and i recall the day in my childhood where in my insistence to become a world champion roller bladder i fell and scrapped my knee and i recall the comforted feeling of being cradled in her arms in fetal position and i recall never wanting to leave the warmth of the embrace and just as i begin to reach out i crouch and close my eyes to the familiar feeling that boils over in my stomach falling in and out of consciousness i see quick flashes i see my mother s crystal blue eyes well with tears that could not be held i see her strong posture and i see the unfamiliar men gather bowing and shaking their heads unsure i see the green lines of the machines jump and dance and i see a sign sloppily and quickly written above my bed the only writing visible to me in my haze it read patient zero
sadie i told you not to stand under the tree in the middle of a thunderstorm my mom frantically dialed 911 as i laid there shocked literally hello my daughter was just struck all of a sudden something was wrong i sat up my fingertips crackling with this new power or was it the aftermath of the lighting i couldn t tell nor did i care no something was definitely wrong and it was nearby if i take 295 south right now i can get to home depot in ten minutes flat and then i can finally build that deck you ve wanted they have the planks on sale i can feel it in my blood now i know they re plum colored and you did specifically say you wanted pine but hear me out here plum is the pinest color out there and you d be a birch to say otherwise my mom looked back at me a hint of recognition in her eyes but the rest of her face read as one emotion terror you know what else i m gon na get like 50 windows from craigslist they have the best deals and make a greenhouse somehow the words kept spilling out of my mouth but something else was off here something with my house suddenly i knew i felt my blood boiling as i continued to be filled with rage i jumped up the rest of the way and dashed the two blocks to my house where my brother s laptop was not home and his computer is plugged in energy waster doesn t he care about this house he could ve burned the whole place down
i do n t want to cut off his head but i do n t really have a choice i close my eyes and just wait for it to be over my insides turn as i feel the swing connect quit being so weak you ve done this before the jock s girlfriend screams on cue looks like she is going to faint she has blonde hair and a blue dress patterned with diamonds i see how scared she is and i feel ashamed i m not the bad guy do i have to remind you remind you how they came here to our home and ransacked our things they are trespassing the door to the bedroom bursts open and another girl storms in i think her name was whitney she is holding a shovel she surveys the scene and i am impressed by how calm she seems i decide to back off but she takes that as a sign to attack the shovel strikes me in the face knocking my mask off before i can recover i am hit again then a third time the fourth strike sends me flying out the window we are currently three stories high how could you let her do that i like the feeling of being weightless bits of shattered glass encompass me sparkling with moonlight i feel like i m floating in space surrounded by stars then i hit the ground and i think i feel a rib break i shift to make sure mother fucker yeah it broke i landed in a pile of bushes which cushioned my fall at least somewhat through the thick tangle of branches i look up toward the broken window whitney is nervously peering out of it scanning the grounds he s gone she shouts before disappearing back into the house you need to get up they are getting away if they get away they will tell others more people will come not just the shitty teenagers either for fuck s sake get up i know i have some time so i take a moment to collect my thoughts i do n t like doing this hurting people it s better now that i m numb to it it s not my fault they keep coming here it s not my fault he makes me hurt them i m not the bad guy from the other side of the house i hear the front door open followed by the shuffle of feet against gravel keep it together cindy i need you to keep it together whitney s voice is stern but supportive though she does n t speak cindy s breathing begins to steady i know they are heading to the car even before i hear the doors open in the next few seconds they will drive off and i can go back to being alone except their car wo n t start you saw to that the engine begins to hang and i hear the girls swearing they keep trying but it s no use he makes me stand up and grab my machete even though i do n t want to he makes me run despite the pain in my side the girls scream as soon as i round the corner they throw open their car doors and begin to flee he tries to make me chase them but i refuse if you ca n t do what needs doing fine i ll do it i am too weak to fight him he takes control of me one limb at a time and everything fades when i wake up i am in the woods it is almost pitch black but i can make out a tiny cabin in the distance i start walking toward it but my foot catches on something almost knocking me over i look down to see a limp figure curled into a ball beneath me she has blonde hair and a blue dress patterned with diamonds some of the diamonds are red now i try not to think about her again as i continue walking as i approach the cabin door something triggers in the back of my mind i feel isolated safe the door creaks as i push it open and walk inside there are pictures covering the walls drawings of spaceships and planets and stars i look closer and find that each picture has something in common a drawing of a boy with a space helmet he looks happy i find something else too a photograph this one is of also of a boy a real one he is sitting in a wagon with a cardboard box on his head cut up to look like the same space helmet in the drawings he is n t alone though there is a man standing behind him his face has been drawn over in a furious series of pen marks though i ca n t see his face the man terrifies me he fills me with the same kind of dread i feel every time i hear a scream comes from behind me followed by another blow to the head i stumble around to see whitney this time holding a metal baseball bat she swings at me again but i catch it in my left hand before i can stop it my right arm shoots forward and strikes her across the face she flies backward onto an old table which breaks underneath her she s on the ground it s time to finish it i do n t want to i do n t care what you want just do what i tell you no do it you piece of shit do it or i will no i throw my machete toward the ground as his shouts fill the room the force of it brings me to my knees even as i resist i begin to feel him taking control my right hand stiffens and begins making its way toward the weapon before he can grab it i kick it away it skids to a halt right next to whitney she picks it up without hesitation and lunges forward it surprises me that i do n t feel pain when the blade enters my chest then a scream pierces through my skull and i know it has hurt him instead i feel my body begin to go limp again though nothing steps in to take control die whitney shouts at me but i do n t blame her i do n t mind that she does n t understand i do n t even care if he does it s only important that i know it that i feel it in my bones even as my vision starts to fade i m not the bad guy

note i just watched episode 1 of season 4 and have n t read any of the books so i do n t know what happens after that please no spoilers this is also my first wp post but constructive feedback is welcome also just for fun i tried to do an unofficial screenplay format hence the weird capitalization fade in to a mound of swords tips facing us we hear footsteps on stone slowly getting closer meanwhile the camera zooms out until we recognize this as the iron throne camera sweeps around the throne until we are in front of middle aged daenarys sitting on the throne face blank after several seconds in addition to the footsteps we now also hear the jangle of a maester s chain both sounds then stop and we hear an aged but familiar voice your grace the camera turns to face sam in full maester garb we see him approaching the camera for a few seconds and then switches to a side view as he stops at the base of the stairs daenarys nods and sam climbs the first set of stairs towards the throne and stops looking from behind sam we see daenarys in the throne which towers above her head to her right stands sir jorah after all these years he s still protectively looking over her the hand of the king s medallion hangs from his armor sam i ve just received word from the wall it s still holding but they do n t think it ll hold much longer attacks are growing in frequency and the summer heat slowly melts the ice daenarys what do you advise grand meister can we do anything sam not yet but i ve heard rumors of an ancient text which tells of a weapon greater than any the world has ever known i was reluctant to seek it out because it involves a look of extreme discomfort crosses his face almost wincing as he speaks the remaining words sam blood magic daenarys as protector of the realm i must do everything in my power to defend my kingdom against the army of white walkers you must seek the red woman at once perhaps she knows of this text jorah disapprovingly khaleesi daenarys i hope to not need it but if the wall may be breached we must be prepared in the meantime my smiths work tirelessly to make swords and attows of dragonstone and convoys arrive weekly at castle black with these weapons and reinforcements and jorah you must stop calling me that i am she stands the room quiets and the theme song plays in the background growing louder until the end of her sentence daenarys thundering daenarys stormborn of house targaryn queen of the seven kingdoms grandmother of dragons and protector of the realm still facing her we hear jorah and sam in unison yes my queen fade into the next scene we see a green lush almost idyllic island at dusk the sea is an unusually bright blue which would be concerning if we did n t remember it as its namesake the sapphire isle this is tarth the camera pans upwards until we see a small group of children playing with wooden swords on a grassy field a ways from the beach a woman stands in front of them a sword fighting teacher the camera continues upwards we see a small castle with a balcony over the field two figures sit on the balcony indistinguishable the camera glimpses a reflection off a golden hand cut to a closeup of jamie and brienne watching the children below they are both old in their fifties we can still make out jamie s unadulterated good looks and brienne still not so much but she still looks as if she could kill you on a moment s notice they occasionally look towards each other and smile as one of the children playfully falls and over exuberantly feigns injury we hear in the distance and from jamie and brienne s perspective we see the field and the glowing water behind arya alright that s it for today and remember what do we say to death children in unison not today the camera shifts to a closeup of arya and follows her movements arya now inside it s getting dark the children drop their swords and run to the castle arya sighs and collects the swords she walks to a nearby house and throws the swords into a shed through the window we see needle framed and mounted on her office wall how did she end up here doing this she would never know fade to next scene i had to stop here today but i have an idea for the storyline which i d like to write if anyone s interested in me continuing
