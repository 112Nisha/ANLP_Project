So many times have I walked on ruins , the remainings of places that I loved and got used to.. At first I was scared , each time I could feel my city , my current generation collapse , break into the black hole that thrives within it , I could feel humanity , the way I 'm able to feel my body.. After a few hundred years , the pattern became obvious , no longer the war and damage that would devastate me over and over again in the far past was effecting me so dominantly . <newline> It 's funny , but I felt as if after gaining what I desired so long , what I have lived for my entire life , only then , when I achieved immortality I started truly aging . <newline> <newline> 5 world wars have passed , and now they feel like a simple sickeness that would pass by every so often , I could no longer evaluate the individual human as a being of its own , the importance of mortals is merely the same as the importance of my skin cells ; They are a part of a mechanism so much more advanced , a mechanism that is so dear to my fallen heart a mechanism that I have seen fall and rise so many times , a mechanism that when lost all of which it had , had me loosing my will to live , for the first time in all of my thousands years of existence . <newline> <newline> Acceptance , something so important . a skill that has proved itself worthy dozens of times , an ability that looks so easy to achieve , a gift , that I was n't able to aquire in all my years , until now . When the ashes on the ground flew into the now empty air upon humanity 's fall , I felt as if all of it 's weight was crushing me . Ignorance took over and I searched years for a hope , a sign of the very same patterns that I used to watch reappear every hundred years , the very core of my will to exist that was now no more that I so strongly wish was . <newline> <newline> If you have ever wondered if silence can drive people crazy , it can.. <newline> I ca n't feel my legs , I have walked for days , just to hear the sound of gravel , crushed bones , crushed buildings and crushed civilizations under my steps to keep my sanity.. until I remembered , the day in my far past . The day of my rebirth , I took out of my pocket a small plastic box , with nine buttons and a small glass window . I could n't believe this was our past , I could n't believe how far we have been able to progress and yet , be destroyed by our own violence . <newline> I slowly dialed the number I was given , exactly 1729 years ago . <newline> <newline> I dropped a tear , a tear that was too slow to hit the ground as I got sucked into the darkness that emerged around me . <newline> <newline> A chill went through my spine as I saw my destiny rise above me , I could see the white teeth under the dark cloack ... <newline> <newline> `` You have finally arrived '' He projected into my mind , with the most chilling cold and unhuman voice . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm ready to obey '' I answered . I knew who was sitting infront of me , and it was time for me to obey him , after all these years of playing god , even I came to it . <newline> <newline> Funny is n't it ? Even by achieving immortality , death , is inescapable .
-Week 18 aboard the Depth Reaver , Circa 2023- <newline> <newline> I walk about the dull gray halls , the artificial gravity making my steps feel almost as if they were on land . Almost . I glance out a window as I pass it by . There 's the sun , and there 's the moon right there . And , of course , there 's the Earth . I kinda miss it . Then again , space is pretty cool . It 's got some brilliant views , and the wifi is surprisingly good . Even countless miles away from the Earth , I can crush Silver noobs on CS GO . <newline> <newline> I pass by Dale Malkowitz , the head scientist on board . <newline> <newline> `` Evening , Dale , '' I say . <newline> <newline> `` What up , Danny ? '' he replies cordially . <newline> <newline> `` Nothin ' much . A little bored , I guess . '' <newline> <newline> He shakes his head in disbelief . `` I really , *really* do n't understand how you can be bored in space . '' <newline> <newline> `` Well hey , '' I say slightly defensively , `` Aside from the views , it 's kinda ... dull . And empty . And stuff . '' <newline> <newline> `` Whatever you say , Wittell , '' he says , not unkindly . Then he walks off . A few moments pass , and then I decide to look out the window right by me . As my eyes scan the inky blackness of space ( again ) , I notice something odd about the moon 's surface . It 's slightly ... cracked . <newline> <newline> `` Hey , Malkowitz ? '' I call out , `` You might wan na check this out ! '' <newline> <newline> He walks over to me casually , probably expecting nothing . `` What ? '' he asks , `` What do you see ? '' <newline> <newline> I point at the moon . His brow furrows . `` Huh ... I guess there 's something up with the surface . I 'll have to look into tha- '' <newline> <newline> Suddenly , the surface cracks a little more . We glance at each other , and then back at the moon , and then at each other again , and then back at the moon again . <newline> <newline> `` What 's going on ? '' I ask , alarmed . <newline> <newline> He 's silent for a minute or two , mouth hanging open . Then , he calls out : `` Janice ! Terry ! Johnny ! Get over here ! Something 's up with the moon . '' <newline> <newline> The other crewmates enter , unsure of what to expect . As their eyes lay upon the moon 's surface cracks , they widen . <newline> <newline> And , by coincidence , more cracks appear at that very moment . And then more . And more . And more . And more ... <newline> <newline> Little bits of the moon begin to float away , torn free of the rest of the surface . We all stare , speechless . And then ... it happens . It *happens* . <newline> <newline> The side of the moon facing us is ... torn away by a ... <newline> <newline> Human ... hand ? <newline> <newline> And we see ... <newline> <newline> A giant ... human face ? ! <newline> <newline> Surprisingly , I can hear my thoughts over my racing heart . *I ca n't help but feel as if I recognize that face ... from the ... * <newline> <newline> *Internet . * <newline> <newline> Suddenly , the great face 's lips move . <newline> <newline> Of course , none of us can actually *hear* it speak , because of the laws of space and whatnot . However , I can read its lips , and it appears to be saying : <newline> <newline> `` Are you sure about that ? ''
I was feckin ' sloshed , mate . First time I ever was in the Big Lemon , and I 'd found me the best feckin ' pub I could imagine , I tell ya what . So I stumble out when it was closin ' time , musta been 'round 4 o'clock in the morning , and made my way through some alleys to find the quaint little AirBnB place I 'd rented for the week . <newline> <newline> A'course , that 's how many a horror story starts , ainnit ? But it was all fun and games at first . There was this bloke I saw comin ' towards me in the alley , dark as it was with only a few lights from some apartments overhead , where the folk were still awake . At least , I thought it was a bloke , but he looked more like there was n't something right with the whole alleyway . Like it was a painting someone had gone and ripped with a knife for some reason , fecked-up as it all looked , and the cut looked sort of weird and silvery , and wavy like a heat haze comin ' from a welder 's torch . <newline> <newline> Now this thing must 've been a good foot or five taller 'n me , but sloshed as I am , I just take off my hat and give it a good `` how-do-you-do '' , 'cause I 'm a nice fellow and I wan na pass , y'see ? Now this thing up and goes give me a `` mighty fine , how about y'self , sir ! '' I feckin ' quite pissed my britches ! More in surprise 'n anythin ' , really , but I keep my composure and just sorta try and pass 'm as he walks past me with his long , spindly legs as silvery as the rest of 'm , with his feet makin ' noises like he 's wearin ' cowboy boots with those thingies on 'm . But then that moment stupid old me finds I forgot my lighter at the pub , and so I turn and ask spindleboots there if he 's got some fire for me . <newline> <newline> Darn buggerer turns around on the spot faster 'n my eyes can see and says , he says `` sure ! I got your fire here . '' And the feckin ' thing stretches out one of his spindly legs and wraps it around me like a cobra and pulls me into itself . Devil 's pits , that felt like I was bein ' burnt layer of skin by layer . He sure got me with that . Good feckin ' joke , mate . <newline> <newline> Must 've been out like a light for ages , but when I woke up , I find myself here . So tell me , Doc : are time travellers really that sought after as subjects of study ? 'Cause I know you found me in your fancy cyberwebs database thing and I ca n't be three hundred years old as my passport would say if I had one , but I 'd really like to not die , y'know ? What do y'say , wan na go and grab a beer at the pub ?
“ No , no no no ... ” She backed up and turned the other way the second she saw me heading towards her . <newline> <newline> “ Hey ! ” Starting to walk quickly now I picked up my pace until I nearly ran into her . She tried to duck behind one of the men carrying samples around the food court but instead just managed an awkward half step around him before I grabbed her shoulder . She turned towards me so I could get a clear view of her face . Now I was sure it was her . “ Joanne ? ” Her eyes lit up , if only for a second before she turned back around , grabbed her hands and lowered her head before once again repeating her rant of no ’ s from earlier . <newline> <newline> “ You can ’ t be here , not now . I finally get this far and now you ’ re here. ” She was mumbling more to herself than to me at this point . <newline> <newline> “ You… you ’ re real , ” I said , looking back to her eyes . “ How… do you know who I am ? ” <newline> <newline> “ I ’ m real ? Of course I ’ m real ! But you can ’ t be here ! ” Now she was talking directly to me . “ Do you know what kinds of hell you put me through ? The amount of bullying , stress , and endless therapy ! Dave , I finally get rid of you and now you have to come back in my head and tear it back out from under me , ” she slapped her head a few times as she delivered the last line . <newline> <newline> “ What are you talking about ? I- ” <newline> <newline> “ We were best friends , true or false ? ” She asked . <newline> <newline> “ True , no false , I mean , we were friends but not… ” I looked at her once more to make sure she was actually standing there . “ You ’ re a dream , ” She froze at this . <newline> <newline> “ No , no I ’ m- you ’ re a hallucination . I saw you for years ! Every waking moment from- ” <newline> <newline> “ Seven until twelve ” I looked at her shaking my head , incredulous to what was happening . <newline> <newline> “ When we fell out of that tree that one summer , ” she smiled for just a second before frowning again and looking down . <newline> <newline> “ But that was just a dream , I woke up right after that. ” <newline> <newline> “ No , that actually happened . I was awake , I remember it exactly because that ’ s when I still lived in Australia with my parents. ” I looked at her , and began to realize something . <newline> <newline> “ You saw me when you were awake , I dreamt you while I was asleep . I lived in Boston , when you lived in Australia. ” <newline> <newline> “ Hold on , ” She sat down . “ My head hurts , ” She paused . “ We met , every day- ” <newline> “ Night , ” I corrected . She looked at me and scowled . <newline> <newline> “ Every day . For five years , until we fell . What happened after that ? ” <newline> <newline> “ I told you , I woke up. ” <newline> <newline> “ No , what happened for me ? I don ’ t remember anything but falling head first and then… ” <newline> <newline> “ Joanne , ” I looked her straight in the eyes this time . “ I woke up. ” <newline>
There 's a magical moment between wakefulness and sleep , a moment where noise seems to reach a crescendo but everything is so calm right as you crash into the warm waves of sleep . As my eyes closed the only thing I saw was the time on the TV screen in front of me , faded blue numbers that read 10:34AM . <newline> <newline> Unless your plane explodes . Searing heat tears through flesh and shard of metal pierce every nerve , for a fraction of a fraction of a moment there is nothing but horrendous pain and then there is darkness . <newline> <newline> That 's when I woke up , drenched in sweat , eyes wide with fear and panic . The first thing I noticed was the time . <newline> <newline> 9:35AM <newline> <newline> It had been so real . It was real . That was no dream , it could n't have been ... <newline> <newline> I glance around to my fellow passengers and wonder how it happened . What caused it ? Can we stop it ? Stop the plane , I want to get off ? <newline> <newline> I 've been a cop for a long time , that 's the good news . <newline> <newline> The bad ? <newline> <newline> I 'm stuck in a metal tube that I think is going to explode in less than an hour and I have to find out how without panicking anyone . <newline> <newline> Especially if I 'm wrong . <newline> <newline> But what if I 'm right ? <newline> <newline> No resources , no back-up , no escape . <newline> <newline> Fuck it , no problem . <newline> <newline> ***** <newline> <newline> 9:36AM <newline> <newline> Alright . <newline> <newline> There 's got to be at least 300 people on board , not including crew . It could be mechanical and it 's going up in flames no matter what and that 's bad news . We 're too far away to do anything about that , the map shows somewhere over the Pacific . <newline> <newline> That 's really bad . Not like anyone would believe me . <newline> <newline> I 'm not entirely sure I believe me . <newline> <newline> My only hope is that I can find out what causes the whole thing before the whole thing happens . <newline> <newline> Terrorism ? I mean , I guess it could be but that 's a slim shot in the dark . <newline> <newline> So what in the blue hell blows up a plane over the ocean ? <newline> <newline> First stop ? Bathroom . Experience an explosion is enough to make you feel the urge to ... relieve yourself . <newline> <newline> That 's when I see her . I stand and she 's further back but she 's got that look on her face . The sweat , the panic . She saw it too . <newline> <newline> The good ? I guess I have a partner . <newline> <newline> The bad ? I might not be wrong . <newline> <newline> **** <newline> <newline> 9:37AM <newline> <newline> I wave to her and motion towards the washrooms . <newline> <newline> `` You saw it ? '' <newline> <newline> She nodded . <newline> <newline> `` Did you see anything ? '' <newline> <newline> She shook her head . <newline> <newline> This was n't productive . There had to be something , some piece of information that either of us had buried in our brains that would be useful . Then something clicked . <newline> <newline> `` Do you remember which way the explosion came from ? '' <newline> <newline> She tilted her head as if she was remembering . <newline> <newline> `` Yeah , the heat was in front of me . What the hell is going on ? '' <newline> <newline> I looked back to the passengers . There were six rows between her seat and mine . Six rows of nine , that 's ... 54 if any math from school stuck . <newline> <newline> `` Hey , did you hear me ? '' She said , grabbing my arm . <newline> <newline> `` Yeah ! It came from in front of you . It came from behind me . So that means- '' <newline> <newline> `` It started somewhere between us . '' She finished , which would usually annoy me but in this case it was nice to have someone pick up on it nice and quick . <newline> <newline> I checked my watch . <newline> <newline> 9:41AM . <newline> <newline> We were running out of time . <newline> <newline> **** <newline> <newline> 9:42AM <newline> <newline> `` Does anyone stick out to you ? '' she whispered and I shook my head . We could probably eliminate a few potential suspects by process of elimination . A young family probably was n't going to cause a problem , the elderly couple as well . Stuff like that . <newline> <newline> As I watched I saw there were three people acting nervously . <newline> <newline> One portly man checking his watch a little too frequently . <newline> <newline> A younger man sweating profusely . <newline> <newline> A woman glancing around with what I would describe as suspicion . <newline> <newline> I pointed them out to her and she agreed . So maybe we had three suspects . Or maybe we had three nervous flyers . <newline> <newline> 9:45AM . <newline> <newline> Seconds were ticking by and we had a very limited number of those to start . <newline> <newline> As we stood there a flight attendant approached us from behind . <newline> <newline> She startled both of us and that 's when the woman turned and locked eyes with me . Then her eyes went wide and she knew that someone knew . She bolted from her seat and reached for the overhead compartment . That 's when I slammed into her full force , throwing both our bodies to the hard floor and skidding at least three rows ahead . <newline> <newline> When I lifted my head I was staring down the barrel of a handgun . <newline> <newline> A young man , sweating profusely , was holding the right end of it and I was definitely on the wrong end . <newline> <newline> He was n't holding a badge though . Which meant things were going from bad to worse .
The mountain stood still and large beneath the Warrior . It had not trembled in the days since the people chose him as their Champion . `` Perhaps the Dragon slumbers yet , '' he thought . `` I shall wake him , soon enough . '' He strode forward , heavily , in his iron raiment , shining dully in the morning sun . The shrouded peak drew slowly nearer as the sun climbed the sky , mirroring the Warrior 's toil this day as the last . The Dragon slept silently in its lair amidst the clouds . <newline> <newline> For generations the people had not seen it wake . But their stories , told by night and hearth fire , still remained hushed in reverence of its deadly wrath . Legends told of it waking and the destruction that followed . But that was before . Before the people had tamed iron and bent it to their will . Now they had weapons that could fight the myth . That could quench the fire . <newline> <newline> The Warrior stopped at the edge of the cloud bank , just as the sun had stopped there hours before . He breathed . Deliberately he pulled the heavy iron axe from his belt and gripped it between strong hands . A glow had appeared within the clouds . The mountain rumbled . <newline> <newline> `` I have come to wake you , beast , and I have come to show you the people no longer fear you . '' The ground rolled and thundered . He roared in defiance and raised his axe , charging into the fog . He half ran and climbed in muffled beats as his bloodlust for the Dragon pounded in his ears . The glow grew brighter and the ground shook violently . <newline> <newline> A gout of flame split the clouds in front of the Warrior and he saw his destination . The rock ended in a ridge just above him and the Dragons flames beat and splashed beyond . Without breaking stride , the iron Warrior crested the ridge and leapt , axe raised high , into a pit of Dragon fire .
I open my eyes in a panic , sweat beading and then falling down my face . I look around and the sun in shining through the maroon curtains of my studio apartment . Everything seems to be as I left it the afternoon before , but there is a heavy , unfamiliar air in the room . I notice the throw cover I lazily hang to separate my twin size bed from the rest of the apartment has been ripped to the ground , and that the kitchen faucet rhythmically drips against the cold steel sink . I was alone last night like I always am , I think . No one has been here but me in over three months . <newline> <newline> I 'm not allowed to think about it much longer , as the feeling in my stomach bubbles over and pops once more as it had been doing all night , slowly worsening . I pinch my eyes shut , knowing what 's coming next , and for just one moment , as the pain peaks like a giant wave waiting to break , I think I may just die this time . And just as quickly , the wave reaches the shore , and I know I have a few moments of peace . I open my eyes and look around . I ca n't help but surrender to the weight of them after a few moments , and I drift to an uneasy sleep , as the tension escapes from my stomach and from the rest of my body , dissipating into the small space I call home . <newline> <newline> The next wave takes what remains in me and decimates it . The pain blinds me , numbing me to all feeling and sensation . The relief never comes as I close my eyes involuntarily . <newline> <newline> I finally come to and realize I had been asleep for a while . I open my eyes and , fighting the blinding lights and white room , I see that the natural maroon lighting of my apartment has been replaced by white hospital lights . Beyond the thick glass walls of the room that was smaller than my apartment - though I did n't think it got smaller than that - stand people I have never seen before , looking at papers and analyzing the rhythms of the machines I now realize I am hooked up to . The men all stop and slowly turn their unexpected gazes at me as I begin to curl my sore body into a seated position , only to be shocked back down by a face that made the sea of unfamiliar faces fade away . <newline> <newline> The prominent cheekbones that made my mother seem so much prouder than her nature would actually allow remained strong , though the rest of her seemed to be worn down by the years . The same mahogany curls fell across those cheeks and down right above her shoulders , though they seemed more ashen now . Her frail yet determined hand touching the impenetrable glass and reaching to pick me up and hold me , and I recall the day in my childhood where , in my insistence to become a world champion roller bladder , I fell and scrapped my knee . And I recall the comforted feeling of being cradled in her arms in fetal position . And I recall never wanting to leave the warmth of the embrace . <newline> <newline> And just as I begin to reach out , I crouch and close my eyes to the familiar feeling that boils over in my stomach . Falling in and out of consciousness , I see quick flashes . I see my mother 's crystal blue eyes well with tears that could not be held . I see her strong posture and I see the unfamiliar men gather , bowing and shaking their heads , unsure . I see the green lines of the machines jump and dance . And I see a sign , sloppily and quickly written above my bed , the only writing visible to me in my haze . It read `` Patient Zero '' .
“ Sadie ! I told you not to stand under the tree in the middle of a thunderstorm ! ” <newline> <newline> My mom frantically dialed 911 , as I laid there , shocked . Literally . <newline> <newline> “ Hello ? ! My daughter was just struck- “ <newline> <newline> All of a sudden , something was wrong . I sat up , my fingertips crackling with this new power . Or was it the aftermath of the lighting ? I couldn ’ t tell . Nor did I care . No . Something was definitely wrong , and it was nearby . <newline> <newline> “ If I take 295 south right now , I can get to Home Depot in ten minutes flat . And then I can finally build that deck you ’ ve wanted , they have the planks on sale . I can feel it in my blood . Now , I know , they ’ re plum colored and you did specifically say you wanted pine , but hear me out here . Plum is the pinest color out there , and you ’ d be a birch to say otherwise. ” <newline> <newline> My mom looked back at me , a hint of recognition in her eyes , but the rest of her face read as one emotion : terror . <newline> <newline> “ You know what else ? I ’ m gon na get like , 50 windows from craigslist , they have the best deals , and make a greenhouse ! ” <newline> <newline> Somehow , the words kept spilling out of my mouth . But something else was off here . Something with my house… <newline> <newline> Suddenly , I knew . I felt my blood boiling as I continued to be filled with rage . I jumped up the rest of the way , and dashed the two blocks to my house , where my brother ’ s laptop was . <newline> <newline> “ Not . Home . And his computer is plugged in . ENERGY WASTER ! Doesn ’ t he care about this house ? ! He could ’ ve burned the whole place down ! ” <newline>
I do n't want to cut off his head , but I do n't really have a choice . I close my eyes and just wait for it to be over . My insides turn as I feel the swing connect . <newline> <newline> *Quit being so weak ! You 've done this before . * <newline> <newline> The jock 's girlfriend screams on cue , looks like she is going to faint . She has blonde hair and a blue dress patterned with diamonds . I see how scared she is , and I feel ashamed . I 'm not the bad guy . <newline> <newline> *Do I have to remind you ? Remind you how they came here -- to OUR home -- and ransacked OUR things ? They are trespassing ! * <newline> <newline> The door to the bedroom bursts open , and another girl storms in . I think her name was Whitney . She is holding a shovel . She surveys the scene , and I am impressed by how calm she seems . I decide to back off , but she takes that as a sign to attack . The shovel strikes me in the face , knocking my mask off . Before I can recover , I am hit again . Then a third time . The fourth strike sends me flying out the window . We are currently three stories high . <newline> <newline> *How could you let her do that ? * <newline> <newline> I like the feeling of being weightless . Bits of shattered glass encompass me , sparkling with moonlight . I feel like I 'm floating in space , surrounded by stars . Then I hit the ground and I think I feel a rib break . I shift to make sure . <newline> <newline> *Mother fucker ! * <newline> <newline> Yeah ... it broke . <newline> <newline> I landed in a pile of bushes , which cushioned my fall at least somewhat . Through the thick tangle of branches , I look up toward the broken window . Whitney is nervously peering out of it , scanning the grounds . <newline> <newline> `` He 's gone . '' she shouts before disappearing back into the house . <newline> <newline> *You need to get up . They are getting away . If they get away , they will tell others . More people will come . Not just the shitty teenagers , either . For fuck 's sake , GET UP ! * <newline> <newline> I know I have some time , so I take a moment to collect my thoughts . I do n't like doing this : hurting people . It 's better now that I 'm numb to it . It 's not my fault they keep coming here . It 's not my fault he makes me hurt them . I 'm not the bad guy . <newline> <newline> From the other side of the house , I hear the front door open , followed by the shuffle of feet against gravel . <newline> <newline> `` Keep it together , Cindy . I need you to keep it together '' Whitney 's voice is stern but supportive . <newline> <newline> Though she does n't speak , Cindy 's breathing begins to steady . <newline> <newline> I know they are heading to the car even before I hear the doors open . In the next few seconds , they will drive off , and I can go back to being alone . <newline> <newline> *Except their car wo n't start . You saw to that . * <newline> <newline> The engine begins to hang , and I hear the girls swearing . They keep trying , but it 's no use . <newline> <newline> He makes me stand up and grab my machete even though I do n't want to . He makes me run despite the pain in my side . The girls scream as soon as I round the corner . They throw open their car doors and begin to flee . He tries to make me chase them , but I refuse . <newline> <newline> *If you ca n't do what needs doing , fine . I 'll do it ! * <newline> <newline> I am too weak to fight him . He takes control of me , one limb at a time , and everything fades . <newline> <newline> When I wake up , I am in the woods . It is almost pitch black , but I can make out a tiny cabin in the distance . I start walking toward it , but my foot catches on something , almost knocking me over . I look down to see a limp figure curled into a ball beneath me . She has blonde hair and a blue dress patterned with diamonds . Some of the diamonds are red now . I try not to think about her again as I continue walking . <newline> <newline> As I approach the cabin door , something triggers in the back of my mind . I feel isolated , safe . The door creaks as I push it open and walk inside . <newline> <newline> There are pictures covering the walls , drawings of spaceships and planets and stars . I look closer and find that each picture has something in common : a drawing of a boy with a space helmet . He looks happy . I find something else , too : a photograph . <newline> <newline> This one is of also of a boy , a real one . He is sitting in a wagon with a cardboard box on his head , cut up to look like the same space helmet in the drawings . He is n't alone , though ; there is a man standing behind him . His face has been drawn over in a furious series of pen marks . Though I ca n't see his face , the man terrifies me . He fills me with the same kind of dread I feel every time I hear -- <newline> <newline> A scream comes from behind me , followed by another blow to the head . I stumble around to see Whitney , this time holding a metal baseball bat . She swings at me again , but I catch it in my left hand . Before I can stop it , my right arm shoots forward and strikes her across the face . She flies backward onto an old table , which breaks underneath her . <newline> <newline> *She 's on the ground . It 's time to finish it . * <newline> <newline> I do n't want to . <newline> <newline> *I do n't care what you want , just do what I tell you . * <newline> <newline> No . <newline> <newline> *Do it , you piece of shit . Do it or I will ! * <newline> <newline> NO ! <newline> <newline> I throw my machete toward the ground as his shouts fill the room . The force of it brings me to my knees . Even as I resist , I begin to feel him taking control . My right hand stiffens and begins making its way toward the weapon . Before he can grab it , I kick it away . It skids to a halt right next to Whitney . She picks it up without hesitation and lunges forward . <newline> <newline> It surprises me that I do n't feel pain when the blade enters my chest . Then a scream pierces through my skull and I know it has hurt him instead . I feel my body begin to go limp again , though nothing steps in to take control . <newline> <newline> `` Die ! '' Whitney shouts at me , but I do n't blame her . <newline> <newline> I do n't mind that she does n't understand . I do n't even care if he does . It 's only important that I know it , that I feel it in my bones even as my vision starts to fade . <newline> <newline> I 'm not the bad guy .
For years we had been warned . <newline> Since the 40 's a sparse few had seen the pattern and tried to warn us . <newline> Nutjobs we called them , conspiracy theorists . <newline> <newline> It was supposed to be a day of celebration , the republicans and democrats had been swept away in the election by the newly formed 'unionists ' . <newline> It was at the Swearing-In Ceremony that they chose to strike . <newline> <newline> Close to a million were gathered to witness the ceremony , when our newly elected president 'Dave Johnson ' ripped his facial mask of and revealed his true , reptilian face . <newline> `` Sstupid little monkeyss . We have played you from the sshadowss for decadess . Now , it iss time for uss to take our rightfull place ass your overlordss ! '' <newline> Scream of joy quickly turned to screams of terror as reptilians revealed themselfs everywhere you looked . <newline> Every guard and secret service member present had thrown off their masks and were holding their guns towards the crowd . <newline> `` Do NOT ressisst uss ! We have ruled you pathetic ssociety for yearss ! we have replaced every leader ! We have-.. '' the sentence was cut short by an ear deafening boom . <newline> <newline> `` Anthony , what iss that ? ! what iss going on ? ! ! '' <newline> Dave could only hiss at fellow reptilians as a large alien ship was currently hovering far above them and was sending waves of what appeared to be odd looking silver chariots towards the gathered crowd . <newline> The reptiles , not knowing what to , simply watched along with the crowd as a giant holoscreen appread in the sky . <newline> <newline> The creature that appeared tall , sleek and had grey , almost silverish skin . <newline> 'Organics of Joo'el . We must utilies your planet to halt the Grox advance . This process involves destroying your planet , thus killing you , sorry . ' <newline> `` You have got to be sshitting me ! , I 've only been their ruler for 5 minutess and thiss sshit happenss ! ! '' <newline> <newline> 'Defecation is irrelevant , local warlord . ' <newline> <newline> `` That'ss not what it meanss ! ! '' <newline> Daves scales had gone from green to red during the announcement and it was only getting worse as he continued to yell at the image in the sky . <newline> <newline> `` We sstayed hidden for yearss for thiss to happen ! We wo n't let you take thiss planet when we are on the brink of victory ! You silver spoon ! ! '' <newline> <newline> 'Consent is irrelevant , local warlord . Gobal distribution achived , commencing planetary modifications , please remain calm . ' <newline> <newline> The silver chariots , seemingly ignoring Earths inhabitants , began to spread out and cut into the ground with lightbeams . <newline> Seconds later , an earthquake hit , and something surfaced with it . <newline> Most chariots managed to dodge in time , but those that did n't were smashed by giant constructs emerging from the earth . <newline> The golems were covered in lines emitting the same yellow light that came from their eyes . <newline> At their full height , they were at least 30 storys tall . <newline> Every chariot retreated to a safer distance . <newline> <newline> `` The fuck iss thiss ? ! ! '' <newline> <newline> 'Reproduction is irrelevant , local warlord . ' <newline> <newline> `` SSHUT UP SSILVER TURD ! ! ! '' <newline> <newline> A bellowing voice shook the ground . Forcing those on the ground to cover their ears . <newline> <newline> { We have lain dormant for aeons . We have waited , we have awoken . } <newline> <newline> 'We must utilise this planet to- ' <newline> <newline> `` WE KNOW ! ! ! '' <newline> <newline> { We have waited for- } <newline> <newline> `` I DO N'T CARE ! ! ! '' <newline> <newline> Dave had actually managed to outshout the booming voice from the ground . More than that , anyone near him could see steam rising from his glowing red scales . <newline> <newline> `` We have worked for thiss moument for generationss ! I will not let it be ruined by ssilverware , or dirtpiles , or anything elsse ! ! '' <newline> <newline> Just as Dave had finished , a rift in space above him opened , allowing a small spaceship to pass through before closing . <newline> The spaceship , no bigger than a small car , was hovering 20 feet above Daves scalely head . <newline> <newline> { Oh oh } <newline> <newline> 'Oh no , an Arbiter has arrived . ' <newline> <newline> `` The fuck iss an Arbiter ? ! '' <newline> <newline> 'Reproduction is still irrelevant . ' <newline> <newline> `` SSHUT UP ! ! ! ''
Note : I just watched Episode 1 of Season 4 and have n't read any of the books , so I do n't know what happens after that . Please no spoilers ! This is also my first WP post , but constructive feedback is welcome . Also , just for fun I tried to do an unofficial screenplay format , hence the weird capitalization . <newline> <newline> -- - <newline> <newline> Fade in to a mound of swords , tips facing us . We hear footsteps on stone , slowly getting closer . Meanwhile , the camera zooms out until we recognize this as The Iron Throne . Camera sweeps around the throne , until we are in front of middle-aged DAENARYS sitting on the throne , face blank . <newline> <newline> After several seconds , in addition to the footsteps we now also hear the jangle of a maester 's chain . Both sounds then stop , and we hear an aged but familiar voice , `` Your Grace ... '' <newline> <newline> The camera turns to face SAM , in full maester garb . We see him approaching the camera for a few seconds , and then switches to a side view as he stops at the base of the stairs . DAENARYS nods and SAM climbs the first set of stairs towards the throne and stops . <newline> <newline> Looking from behind SAM we see DAENARYS in the throne which towers above her head . To her right stands SIR JORAH , after all these years , he 's still protectively looking over her . The Hand of the King 's medallion hangs from his armor . <newline> <newline> SAM : I 've just received word from The Wall . It 's still holding , but they do n't think it 'll hold much longer . Attacks are growing in frequency and the summer heat slowly melts the ice . <newline> <newline> DAENARYS : What do you advise , Grand Meister ? Can we do anything ? <newline> <newline> SAM : Not yet , but I 've heard rumors of an ancient text which tells of a weapon greater than any the world has ever known . I was reluctant to seek it out because it involves ... <newline> <newline> A look of extreme discomfort crosses his face , almost wincing as he speaks the remaining words . <newline> <newline> SAM : ... blood magic . <newline> <newline> DAENARYS : As protector of the realm , I must do everything in my power to defend my kingdom against the army of White Walkers . You must seek the RED WOMAN at once , perhaps she knows of this text . <newline> <newline> JORAH , disapprovingly : Khaleesi ... <newline> <newline> DAENARYS : I hope to not need it . But if the wall may be breached , we must be prepared . In the meantime , my smiths work tirelessly to make swords and attows of Dragonstone , and convoys arrive weekly at Castle Black with these weapons and reinforcements . And Jorah , you must stop calling me that . I am ... <newline> <newline> She stands , the room quiets and the theme song plays in the background , growing louder until the end of her sentence . <newline> <newline> DAENARYS , thundering : Daenarys Stormborn of House Targaryn , Queen of The Seven Kingdoms , Grandmother of Dragons and Protector of the Realm . <newline> <newline> Still facing her , we hear <newline> <newline> JORAH and SAM ( in unison ) : Yes , my queen . <newline> <newline> Fade into the next scene . <newline> <newline> -- -- <newline> <newline> We see a green , lush , almost idyllic island at dusk . The sea is an unusually bright blue , which would be concerning if we did n't remember it as its namesake , The Sapphire Isle . This is Tarth . <newline> <newline> The camera pans upwards until we see a small group of children playing with wooden swords on a grassy field a ways from the beach . A woman stands in front of them , a sword fighting teacher . The camera continues upwards . We see a small castle , with a balcony over the field . Two figures sit on the balcony , indistinguishable . The camera glimpses a reflection off a golden hand . <newline> <newline> Cut to a closeup of JAMIE and BRIENNE watching the children below . They are both old , in their fifties . We can still make out JAMIE 's unadulterated good looks , and BRIENNE still ... not so much . But she still looks as if she could kill you on a moment 's notice . They occasionally look towards each other and smile as one of the children playfully falls and over-exuberantly feigns injury . <newline> <newline> We hear in the distance , and from JAMIE and BRIENNE 's perspective we see the field and the glowing water behind . <newline> <newline> ARYA : Alright , that 's it for today . And remember , what do we say to Death ? <newline> <newline> CHILDREN ( in unison ) : NOT TODAY ! <newline> <newline> The camera shifts to a closeup of ARYA and follows her movements . <newline> <newline> ARYA : Now inside , it 's getting dark . <newline> <newline> The children drop their swords and run to the castle . ARYA sighs and collects the swords . She walks to a nearby house and throws the swords into a shed . Through the window , we see Needle , framed and mounted on her office wall . How did she end up here , doing this ? She would never know . <newline> <newline> Fade to next scene . <newline> <newline> -- - <newline> <newline> I had to stop here today , but I have an idea for the storyline which I 'd like to write if anyone 's interested in me continuing .
So many times have I walked on ruins , the remainings of places that I loved and got used to.. At first I was scared , each time I could feel my city , my current generation collapse , break into the black hole that thrives within it , I could feel humanity , the way I 'm able to feel my body.. After a few hundred years , the pattern became obvious , no longer the war and damage that would devastate me over and over again in the far past was effecting me so dominantly . <newline> It 's funny , but I felt as if after gaining what I desired so long , what I have lived for my entire life , only then , when I achieved immortality I started truly aging . <newline> <newline> 5 world wars have passed , and now they feel like a simple sickeness that would pass by every so often , I could no longer evaluate the individual human as a being of its own , the importance of mortals is merely the same as the importance of my skin cells ; They are a part of a mechanism so much more advanced , a mechanism that is so dear to my fallen heart a mechanism that I have seen fall and rise so many times , a mechanism that when lost all of which it had , had me loosing my will to live , for the first time in all of my thousands years of existence . <newline> <newline> Acceptance , something so important . a skill that has proved itself worthy dozens of times , an ability that looks so easy to achieve , a gift , that I was n't able to aquire in all my years , until now . When the ashes on the ground flew into the now empty air upon humanity 's fall , I felt as if all of it 's weight was crushing me . Ignorance took over and I searched years for a hope , a sign of the very same patterns that I used to watch reappear every hundred years , the very core of my will to exist that was now no more that I so strongly wish was . <newline> <newline> If you have ever wondered if silence can drive people crazy , it can.. <newline> I ca n't feel my legs , I have walked for days , just to hear the sound of gravel , crushed bones , crushed buildings and crushed civilizations under my steps to keep my sanity.. until I remembered , the day in my far past . The day of my rebirth , I took out of my pocket a small plastic box , with nine buttons and a small glass window . I could n't believe this was our past , I could n't believe how far we have been able to progress and yet , be destroyed by our own violence . <newline> I slowly dialed the number I was given , exactly 1729 years ago . <newline> <newline> I dropped a tear , a tear that was too slow to hit the ground as I got sucked into the darkness that emerged around me . <newline> <newline> A chill went through my spine as I saw my destiny rise above me , I could see the white teeth under the dark cloack ... <newline> <newline> `` You have finally arrived '' He projected into my mind , with the most chilling cold and unhuman voice . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm ready to obey '' I answered . I knew who was sitting infront of me , and it was time for me to obey him , after all these years of playing god , even I came to it . <newline> <newline> Funny is n't it ? Even by achieving immortality , death , is inescapable .
-Week 18 aboard the Depth Reaver , Circa 2023- <newline> <newline> I walk about the dull gray halls , the artificial gravity making my steps feel almost as if they were on land . Almost . I glance out a window as I pass it by . There 's the sun , and there 's the moon right there . And , of course , there 's the Earth . I kinda miss it . Then again , space is pretty cool . It 's got some brilliant views , and the wifi is surprisingly good . Even countless miles away from the Earth , I can crush Silver noobs on CS GO . <newline> <newline> I pass by Dale Malkowitz , the head scientist on board . <newline> <newline> `` Evening , Dale , '' I say . <newline> <newline> `` What up , Danny ? '' he replies cordially . <newline> <newline> `` Nothin ' much . A little bored , I guess . '' <newline> <newline> He shakes his head in disbelief . `` I really , *really* do n't understand how you can be bored in space . '' <newline> <newline> `` Well hey , '' I say slightly defensively , `` Aside from the views , it 's kinda ... dull . And empty . And stuff . '' <newline> <newline> `` Whatever you say , Wittell , '' he says , not unkindly . Then he walks off . A few moments pass , and then I decide to look out the window right by me . As my eyes scan the inky blackness of space ( again ) , I notice something odd about the moon 's surface . It 's slightly ... cracked . <newline> <newline> `` Hey , Malkowitz ? '' I call out , `` You might wan na check this out ! '' <newline> <newline> He walks over to me casually , probably expecting nothing . `` What ? '' he asks , `` What do you see ? '' <newline> <newline> I point at the moon . His brow furrows . `` Huh ... I guess there 's something up with the surface . I 'll have to look into tha- '' <newline> <newline> Suddenly , the surface cracks a little more . We glance at each other , and then back at the moon , and then at each other again , and then back at the moon again . <newline> <newline> `` What 's going on ? '' I ask , alarmed . <newline> <newline> He 's silent for a minute or two , mouth hanging open . Then , he calls out : `` Janice ! Terry ! Johnny ! Get over here ! Something 's up with the moon . '' <newline> <newline> The other crewmates enter , unsure of what to expect . As their eyes lay upon the moon 's surface cracks , they widen . <newline> <newline> And , by coincidence , more cracks appear at that very moment . And then more . And more . And more . And more ... <newline> <newline> Little bits of the moon begin to float away , torn free of the rest of the surface . We all stare , speechless . And then ... it happens . It *happens* . <newline> <newline> The side of the moon facing us is ... torn away by a ... <newline> <newline> Human ... hand ? <newline> <newline> And we see ... <newline> <newline> A giant ... human face ? ! <newline> <newline> Surprisingly , I can hear my thoughts over my racing heart . *I ca n't help but feel as if I recognize that face ... from the ... * <newline> <newline> *Internet . * <newline> <newline> Suddenly , the great face 's lips move . <newline> <newline> Of course , none of us can actually *hear* it speak , because of the laws of space and whatnot . However , I can read its lips , and it appears to be saying : <newline> <newline> `` Are you sure about that ? ''
I was feckin ' sloshed , mate . First time I ever was in the Big Lemon , and I 'd found me the best feckin ' pub I could imagine , I tell ya what . So I stumble out when it was closin ' time , musta been 'round 4 o'clock in the morning , and made my way through some alleys to find the quaint little AirBnB place I 'd rented for the week . <newline> <newline> A'course , that 's how many a horror story starts , ainnit ? But it was all fun and games at first . There was this bloke I saw comin ' towards me in the alley , dark as it was with only a few lights from some apartments overhead , where the folk were still awake . At least , I thought it was a bloke , but he looked more like there was n't something right with the whole alleyway . Like it was a painting someone had gone and ripped with a knife for some reason , fecked-up as it all looked , and the cut looked sort of weird and silvery , and wavy like a heat haze comin ' from a welder 's torch . <newline> <newline> Now this thing must 've been a good foot or five taller 'n me , but sloshed as I am , I just take off my hat and give it a good `` how-do-you-do '' , 'cause I 'm a nice fellow and I wan na pass , y'see ? Now this thing up and goes give me a `` mighty fine , how about y'self , sir ! '' I feckin ' quite pissed my britches ! More in surprise 'n anythin ' , really , but I keep my composure and just sorta try and pass 'm as he walks past me with his long , spindly legs as silvery as the rest of 'm , with his feet makin ' noises like he 's wearin ' cowboy boots with those thingies on 'm . But then that moment stupid old me finds I forgot my lighter at the pub , and so I turn and ask spindleboots there if he 's got some fire for me . <newline> <newline> Darn buggerer turns around on the spot faster 'n my eyes can see and says , he says `` sure ! I got your fire here . '' And the feckin ' thing stretches out one of his spindly legs and wraps it around me like a cobra and pulls me into itself . Devil 's pits , that felt like I was bein ' burnt layer of skin by layer . He sure got me with that . Good feckin ' joke , mate . <newline> <newline> Must 've been out like a light for ages , but when I woke up , I find myself here . So tell me , Doc : are time travellers really that sought after as subjects of study ? 'Cause I know you found me in your fancy cyberwebs database thing and I ca n't be three hundred years old as my passport would say if I had one , but I 'd really like to not die , y'know ? What do y'say , wan na go and grab a beer at the pub ?
“ No , no no no ... ” She backed up and turned the other way the second she saw me heading towards her . <newline> <newline> “ Hey ! ” Starting to walk quickly now I picked up my pace until I nearly ran into her . She tried to duck behind one of the men carrying samples around the food court but instead just managed an awkward half step around him before I grabbed her shoulder . She turned towards me so I could get a clear view of her face . Now I was sure it was her . “ Joanne ? ” Her eyes lit up , if only for a second before she turned back around , grabbed her hands and lowered her head before once again repeating her rant of no ’ s from earlier . <newline> <newline> “ You can ’ t be here , not now . I finally get this far and now you ’ re here. ” She was mumbling more to herself than to me at this point . <newline> <newline> “ You… you ’ re real , ” I said , looking back to her eyes . “ How… do you know who I am ? ” <newline> <newline> “ I ’ m real ? Of course I ’ m real ! But you can ’ t be here ! ” Now she was talking directly to me . “ Do you know what kinds of hell you put me through ? The amount of bullying , stress , and endless therapy ! Dave , I finally get rid of you and now you have to come back in my head and tear it back out from under me , ” she slapped her head a few times as she delivered the last line . <newline> <newline> “ What are you talking about ? I- ” <newline> <newline> “ We were best friends , true or false ? ” She asked . <newline> <newline> “ True , no false , I mean , we were friends but not… ” I looked at her once more to make sure she was actually standing there . “ You ’ re a dream , ” She froze at this . <newline> <newline> “ No , no I ’ m- you ’ re a hallucination . I saw you for years ! Every waking moment from- ” <newline> <newline> “ Seven until twelve ” I looked at her shaking my head , incredulous to what was happening . <newline> <newline> “ When we fell out of that tree that one summer , ” she smiled for just a second before frowning again and looking down . <newline> <newline> “ But that was just a dream , I woke up right after that. ” <newline> <newline> “ No , that actually happened . I was awake , I remember it exactly because that ’ s when I still lived in Australia with my parents. ” I looked at her , and began to realize something . <newline> <newline> “ You saw me when you were awake , I dreamt you while I was asleep . I lived in Boston , when you lived in Australia. ” <newline> <newline> “ Hold on , ” She sat down . “ My head hurts , ” She paused . “ We met , every day- ” <newline> “ Night , ” I corrected . She looked at me and scowled . <newline> <newline> “ Every day . For five years , until we fell . What happened after that ? ” <newline> <newline> “ I told you , I woke up. ” <newline> <newline> “ No , what happened for me ? I don ’ t remember anything but falling head first and then… ” <newline> <newline> “ Joanne , ” I looked her straight in the eyes this time . “ I woke up. ” <newline>
There 's a magical moment between wakefulness and sleep , a moment where noise seems to reach a crescendo but everything is so calm right as you crash into the warm waves of sleep . As my eyes closed the only thing I saw was the time on the TV screen in front of me , faded blue numbers that read 10:34AM . <newline> <newline> Unless your plane explodes . Searing heat tears through flesh and shard of metal pierce every nerve , for a fraction of a fraction of a moment there is nothing but horrendous pain and then there is darkness . <newline> <newline> That 's when I woke up , drenched in sweat , eyes wide with fear and panic . The first thing I noticed was the time . <newline> <newline> 9:35AM <newline> <newline> It had been so real . It was real . That was no dream , it could n't have been ... <newline> <newline> I glance around to my fellow passengers and wonder how it happened . What caused it ? Can we stop it ? Stop the plane , I want to get off ? <newline> <newline> I 've been a cop for a long time , that 's the good news . <newline> <newline> The bad ? <newline> <newline> I 'm stuck in a metal tube that I think is going to explode in less than an hour and I have to find out how without panicking anyone . <newline> <newline> Especially if I 'm wrong . <newline> <newline> But what if I 'm right ? <newline> <newline> No resources , no back-up , no escape . <newline> <newline> Fuck it , no problem . <newline> <newline> ***** <newline> <newline> 9:36AM <newline> <newline> Alright . <newline> <newline> There 's got to be at least 300 people on board , not including crew . It could be mechanical and it 's going up in flames no matter what and that 's bad news . We 're too far away to do anything about that , the map shows somewhere over the Pacific . <newline> <newline> That 's really bad . Not like anyone would believe me . <newline> <newline> I 'm not entirely sure I believe me . <newline> <newline> My only hope is that I can find out what causes the whole thing before the whole thing happens . <newline> <newline> Terrorism ? I mean , I guess it could be but that 's a slim shot in the dark . <newline> <newline> So what in the blue hell blows up a plane over the ocean ? <newline> <newline> First stop ? Bathroom . Experience an explosion is enough to make you feel the urge to ... relieve yourself . <newline> <newline> That 's when I see her . I stand and she 's further back but she 's got that look on her face . The sweat , the panic . She saw it too . <newline> <newline> The good ? I guess I have a partner . <newline> <newline> The bad ? I might not be wrong . <newline> <newline> **** <newline> <newline> 9:37AM <newline> <newline> I wave to her and motion towards the washrooms . <newline> <newline> `` You saw it ? '' <newline> <newline> She nodded . <newline> <newline> `` Did you see anything ? '' <newline> <newline> She shook her head . <newline> <newline> This was n't productive . There had to be something , some piece of information that either of us had buried in our brains that would be useful . Then something clicked . <newline> <newline> `` Do you remember which way the explosion came from ? '' <newline> <newline> She tilted her head as if she was remembering . <newline> <newline> `` Yeah , the heat was in front of me . What the hell is going on ? '' <newline> <newline> I looked back to the passengers . There were six rows between her seat and mine . Six rows of nine , that 's ... 54 if any math from school stuck . <newline> <newline> `` Hey , did you hear me ? '' She said , grabbing my arm . <newline> <newline> `` Yeah ! It came from in front of you . It came from behind me . So that means- '' <newline> <newline> `` It started somewhere between us . '' She finished , which would usually annoy me but in this case it was nice to have someone pick up on it nice and quick . <newline> <newline> I checked my watch . <newline> <newline> 9:41AM . <newline> <newline> We were running out of time . <newline> <newline> **** <newline> <newline> 9:42AM <newline> <newline> `` Does anyone stick out to you ? '' she whispered and I shook my head . We could probably eliminate a few potential suspects by process of elimination . A young family probably was n't going to cause a problem , the elderly couple as well . Stuff like that . <newline> <newline> As I watched I saw there were three people acting nervously . <newline> <newline> One portly man checking his watch a little too frequently . <newline> <newline> A younger man sweating profusely . <newline> <newline> A woman glancing around with what I would describe as suspicion . <newline> <newline> I pointed them out to her and she agreed . So maybe we had three suspects . Or maybe we had three nervous flyers . <newline> <newline> 9:45AM . <newline> <newline> Seconds were ticking by and we had a very limited number of those to start . <newline> <newline> As we stood there a flight attendant approached us from behind . <newline> <newline> She startled both of us and that 's when the woman turned and locked eyes with me . Then her eyes went wide and she knew that someone knew . She bolted from her seat and reached for the overhead compartment . That 's when I slammed into her full force , throwing both our bodies to the hard floor and skidding at least three rows ahead . <newline> <newline> When I lifted my head I was staring down the barrel of a handgun . <newline> <newline> A young man , sweating profusely , was holding the right end of it and I was definitely on the wrong end . <newline> <newline> He was n't holding a badge though . Which meant things were going from bad to worse .
The mountain stood still and large beneath the Warrior . It had not trembled in the days since the people chose him as their Champion . `` Perhaps the Dragon slumbers yet , '' he thought . `` I shall wake him , soon enough . '' He strode forward , heavily , in his iron raiment , shining dully in the morning sun . The shrouded peak drew slowly nearer as the sun climbed the sky , mirroring the Warrior 's toil this day as the last . The Dragon slept silently in its lair amidst the clouds . <newline> <newline> For generations the people had not seen it wake . But their stories , told by night and hearth fire , still remained hushed in reverence of its deadly wrath . Legends told of it waking and the destruction that followed . But that was before . Before the people had tamed iron and bent it to their will . Now they had weapons that could fight the myth . That could quench the fire . <newline> <newline> The Warrior stopped at the edge of the cloud bank , just as the sun had stopped there hours before . He breathed . Deliberately he pulled the heavy iron axe from his belt and gripped it between strong hands . A glow had appeared within the clouds . The mountain rumbled . <newline> <newline> `` I have come to wake you , beast , and I have come to show you the people no longer fear you . '' The ground rolled and thundered . He roared in defiance and raised his axe , charging into the fog . He half ran and climbed in muffled beats as his bloodlust for the Dragon pounded in his ears . The glow grew brighter and the ground shook violently . <newline> <newline> A gout of flame split the clouds in front of the Warrior and he saw his destination . The rock ended in a ridge just above him and the Dragons flames beat and splashed beyond . Without breaking stride , the iron Warrior crested the ridge and leapt , axe raised high , into a pit of Dragon fire .
I open my eyes in a panic , sweat beading and then falling down my face . I look around and the sun in shining through the maroon curtains of my studio apartment . Everything seems to be as I left it the afternoon before , but there is a heavy , unfamiliar air in the room . I notice the throw cover I lazily hang to separate my twin size bed from the rest of the apartment has been ripped to the ground , and that the kitchen faucet rhythmically drips against the cold steel sink . I was alone last night like I always am , I think . No one has been here but me in over three months . <newline> <newline> I 'm not allowed to think about it much longer , as the feeling in my stomach bubbles over and pops once more as it had been doing all night , slowly worsening . I pinch my eyes shut , knowing what 's coming next , and for just one moment , as the pain peaks like a giant wave waiting to break , I think I may just die this time . And just as quickly , the wave reaches the shore , and I know I have a few moments of peace . I open my eyes and look around . I ca n't help but surrender to the weight of them after a few moments , and I drift to an uneasy sleep , as the tension escapes from my stomach and from the rest of my body , dissipating into the small space I call home . <newline> <newline> The next wave takes what remains in me and decimates it . The pain blinds me , numbing me to all feeling and sensation . The relief never comes as I close my eyes involuntarily . <newline> <newline> I finally come to and realize I had been asleep for a while . I open my eyes and , fighting the blinding lights and white room , I see that the natural maroon lighting of my apartment has been replaced by white hospital lights . Beyond the thick glass walls of the room that was smaller than my apartment - though I did n't think it got smaller than that - stand people I have never seen before , looking at papers and analyzing the rhythms of the machines I now realize I am hooked up to . The men all stop and slowly turn their unexpected gazes at me as I begin to curl my sore body into a seated position , only to be shocked back down by a face that made the sea of unfamiliar faces fade away . <newline> <newline> The prominent cheekbones that made my mother seem so much prouder than her nature would actually allow remained strong , though the rest of her seemed to be worn down by the years . The same mahogany curls fell across those cheeks and down right above her shoulders , though they seemed more ashen now . Her frail yet determined hand touching the impenetrable glass and reaching to pick me up and hold me , and I recall the day in my childhood where , in my insistence to become a world champion roller bladder , I fell and scrapped my knee . And I recall the comforted feeling of being cradled in her arms in fetal position . And I recall never wanting to leave the warmth of the embrace . <newline> <newline> And just as I begin to reach out , I crouch and close my eyes to the familiar feeling that boils over in my stomach . Falling in and out of consciousness , I see quick flashes . I see my mother 's crystal blue eyes well with tears that could not be held . I see her strong posture and I see the unfamiliar men gather , bowing and shaking their heads , unsure . I see the green lines of the machines jump and dance . And I see a sign , sloppily and quickly written above my bed , the only writing visible to me in my haze . It read `` Patient Zero '' .
“ Sadie ! I told you not to stand under the tree in the middle of a thunderstorm ! ” <newline> <newline> My mom frantically dialed 911 , as I laid there , shocked . Literally . <newline> <newline> “ Hello ? ! My daughter was just struck- “ <newline> <newline> All of a sudden , something was wrong . I sat up , my fingertips crackling with this new power . Or was it the aftermath of the lighting ? I couldn ’ t tell . Nor did I care . No . Something was definitely wrong , and it was nearby . <newline> <newline> “ If I take 295 south right now , I can get to Home Depot in ten minutes flat . And then I can finally build that deck you ’ ve wanted , they have the planks on sale . I can feel it in my blood . Now , I know , they ’ re plum colored and you did specifically say you wanted pine , but hear me out here . Plum is the pinest color out there , and you ’ d be a birch to say otherwise. ” <newline> <newline> My mom looked back at me , a hint of recognition in her eyes , but the rest of her face read as one emotion : terror . <newline> <newline> “ You know what else ? I ’ m gon na get like , 50 windows from craigslist , they have the best deals , and make a greenhouse ! ” <newline> <newline> Somehow , the words kept spilling out of my mouth . But something else was off here . Something with my house… <newline> <newline> Suddenly , I knew . I felt my blood boiling as I continued to be filled with rage . I jumped up the rest of the way , and dashed the two blocks to my house , where my brother ’ s laptop was . <newline> <newline> “ Not . Home . And his computer is plugged in . ENERGY WASTER ! Doesn ’ t he care about this house ? ! He could ’ ve burned the whole place down ! ” <newline>
I do n't want to cut off his head , but I do n't really have a choice . I close my eyes and just wait for it to be over . My insides turn as I feel the swing connect . <newline> <newline> *Quit being so weak ! You 've done this before . * <newline> <newline> The jock 's girlfriend screams on cue , looks like she is going to faint . She has blonde hair and a blue dress patterned with diamonds . I see how scared she is , and I feel ashamed . I 'm not the bad guy . <newline> <newline> *Do I have to remind you ? Remind you how they came here -- to OUR home -- and ransacked OUR things ? They are trespassing ! * <newline> <newline> The door to the bedroom bursts open , and another girl storms in . I think her name was Whitney . She is holding a shovel . She surveys the scene , and I am impressed by how calm she seems . I decide to back off , but she takes that as a sign to attack . The shovel strikes me in the face , knocking my mask off . Before I can recover , I am hit again . Then a third time . The fourth strike sends me flying out the window . We are currently three stories high . <newline> <newline> *How could you let her do that ? * <newline> <newline> I like the feeling of being weightless . Bits of shattered glass encompass me , sparkling with moonlight . I feel like I 'm floating in space , surrounded by stars . Then I hit the ground and I think I feel a rib break . I shift to make sure . <newline> <newline> *Mother fucker ! * <newline> <newline> Yeah ... it broke . <newline> <newline> I landed in a pile of bushes , which cushioned my fall at least somewhat . Through the thick tangle of branches , I look up toward the broken window . Whitney is nervously peering out of it , scanning the grounds . <newline> <newline> `` He 's gone . '' she shouts before disappearing back into the house . <newline> <newline> *You need to get up . They are getting away . If they get away , they will tell others . More people will come . Not just the shitty teenagers , either . For fuck 's sake , GET UP ! * <newline> <newline> I know I have some time , so I take a moment to collect my thoughts . I do n't like doing this : hurting people . It 's better now that I 'm numb to it . It 's not my fault they keep coming here . It 's not my fault he makes me hurt them . I 'm not the bad guy . <newline> <newline> From the other side of the house , I hear the front door open , followed by the shuffle of feet against gravel . <newline> <newline> `` Keep it together , Cindy . I need you to keep it together '' Whitney 's voice is stern but supportive . <newline> <newline> Though she does n't speak , Cindy 's breathing begins to steady . <newline> <newline> I know they are heading to the car even before I hear the doors open . In the next few seconds , they will drive off , and I can go back to being alone . <newline> <newline> *Except their car wo n't start . You saw to that . * <newline> <newline> The engine begins to hang , and I hear the girls swearing . They keep trying , but it 's no use . <newline> <newline> He makes me stand up and grab my machete even though I do n't want to . He makes me run despite the pain in my side . The girls scream as soon as I round the corner . They throw open their car doors and begin to flee . He tries to make me chase them , but I refuse . <newline> <newline> *If you ca n't do what needs doing , fine . I 'll do it ! * <newline> <newline> I am too weak to fight him . He takes control of me , one limb at a time , and everything fades . <newline> <newline> When I wake up , I am in the woods . It is almost pitch black , but I can make out a tiny cabin in the distance . I start walking toward it , but my foot catches on something , almost knocking me over . I look down to see a limp figure curled into a ball beneath me . She has blonde hair and a blue dress patterned with diamonds . Some of the diamonds are red now . I try not to think about her again as I continue walking . <newline> <newline> As I approach the cabin door , something triggers in the back of my mind . I feel isolated , safe . The door creaks as I push it open and walk inside . <newline> <newline> There are pictures covering the walls , drawings of spaceships and planets and stars . I look closer and find that each picture has something in common : a drawing of a boy with a space helmet . He looks happy . I find something else , too : a photograph . <newline> <newline> This one is of also of a boy , a real one . He is sitting in a wagon with a cardboard box on his head , cut up to look like the same space helmet in the drawings . He is n't alone , though ; there is a man standing behind him . His face has been drawn over in a furious series of pen marks . Though I ca n't see his face , the man terrifies me . He fills me with the same kind of dread I feel every time I hear -- <newline> <newline> A scream comes from behind me , followed by another blow to the head . I stumble around to see Whitney , this time holding a metal baseball bat . She swings at me again , but I catch it in my left hand . Before I can stop it , my right arm shoots forward and strikes her across the face . She flies backward onto an old table , which breaks underneath her . <newline> <newline> *She 's on the ground . It 's time to finish it . * <newline> <newline> I do n't want to . <newline> <newline> *I do n't care what you want , just do what I tell you . * <newline> <newline> No . <newline> <newline> *Do it , you piece of shit . Do it or I will ! * <newline> <newline> NO ! <newline> <newline> I throw my machete toward the ground as his shouts fill the room . The force of it brings me to my knees . Even as I resist , I begin to feel him taking control . My right hand stiffens and begins making its way toward the weapon . Before he can grab it , I kick it away . It skids to a halt right next to Whitney . She picks it up without hesitation and lunges forward . <newline> <newline> It surprises me that I do n't feel pain when the blade enters my chest . Then a scream pierces through my skull and I know it has hurt him instead . I feel my body begin to go limp again , though nothing steps in to take control . <newline> <newline> `` Die ! '' Whitney shouts at me , but I do n't blame her . <newline> <newline> I do n't mind that she does n't understand . I do n't even care if he does . It 's only important that I know it , that I feel it in my bones even as my vision starts to fade . <newline> <newline> I 'm not the bad guy .
For years we had been warned . <newline> Since the 40 's a sparse few had seen the pattern and tried to warn us . <newline> Nutjobs we called them , conspiracy theorists . <newline> <newline> It was supposed to be a day of celebration , the republicans and democrats had been swept away in the election by the newly formed 'unionists ' . <newline> It was at the Swearing-In Ceremony that they chose to strike . <newline> <newline> Close to a million were gathered to witness the ceremony , when our newly elected president 'Dave Johnson ' ripped his facial mask of and revealed his true , reptilian face . <newline> `` Sstupid little monkeyss . We have played you from the sshadowss for decadess . Now , it iss time for uss to take our rightfull place ass your overlordss ! '' <newline> Scream of joy quickly turned to screams of terror as reptilians revealed themselfs everywhere you looked . <newline> Every guard and secret service member present had thrown off their masks and were holding their guns towards the crowd . <newline> `` Do NOT ressisst uss ! We have ruled you pathetic ssociety for yearss ! we have replaced every leader ! We have-.. '' the sentence was cut short by an ear deafening boom . <newline> <newline> `` Anthony , what iss that ? ! what iss going on ? ! ! '' <newline> Dave could only hiss at fellow reptilians as a large alien ship was currently hovering far above them and was sending waves of what appeared to be odd looking silver chariots towards the gathered crowd . <newline> The reptiles , not knowing what to , simply watched along with the crowd as a giant holoscreen appread in the sky . <newline> <newline> The creature that appeared tall , sleek and had grey , almost silverish skin . <newline> 'Organics of Joo'el . We must utilies your planet to halt the Grox advance . This process involves destroying your planet , thus killing you , sorry . ' <newline> `` You have got to be sshitting me ! , I 've only been their ruler for 5 minutess and thiss sshit happenss ! ! '' <newline> <newline> 'Defecation is irrelevant , local warlord . ' <newline> <newline> `` That'ss not what it meanss ! ! '' <newline> Daves scales had gone from green to red during the announcement and it was only getting worse as he continued to yell at the image in the sky . <newline> <newline> `` We sstayed hidden for yearss for thiss to happen ! We wo n't let you take thiss planet when we are on the brink of victory ! You silver spoon ! ! '' <newline> <newline> 'Consent is irrelevant , local warlord . Gobal distribution achived , commencing planetary modifications , please remain calm . ' <newline> <newline> The silver chariots , seemingly ignoring Earths inhabitants , began to spread out and cut into the ground with lightbeams . <newline> Seconds later , an earthquake hit , and something surfaced with it . <newline> Most chariots managed to dodge in time , but those that did n't were smashed by giant constructs emerging from the earth . <newline> The golems were covered in lines emitting the same yellow light that came from their eyes . <newline> At their full height , they were at least 30 storys tall . <newline> Every chariot retreated to a safer distance . <newline> <newline> `` The fuck iss thiss ? ! ! '' <newline> <newline> 'Reproduction is irrelevant , local warlord . ' <newline> <newline> `` SSHUT UP SSILVER TURD ! ! ! '' <newline> <newline> A bellowing voice shook the ground . Forcing those on the ground to cover their ears . <newline> <newline> { We have lain dormant for aeons . We have waited , we have awoken . } <newline> <newline> 'We must utilise this planet to- ' <newline> <newline> `` WE KNOW ! ! ! '' <newline> <newline> { We have waited for- } <newline> <newline> `` I DO N'T CARE ! ! ! '' <newline> <newline> Dave had actually managed to outshout the booming voice from the ground . More than that , anyone near him could see steam rising from his glowing red scales . <newline> <newline> `` We have worked for thiss moument for generationss ! I will not let it be ruined by ssilverware , or dirtpiles , or anything elsse ! ! '' <newline> <newline> Just as Dave had finished , a rift in space above him opened , allowing a small spaceship to pass through before closing . <newline> The spaceship , no bigger than a small car , was hovering 20 feet above Daves scalely head . <newline> <newline> { Oh oh } <newline> <newline> 'Oh no , an Arbiter has arrived . ' <newline> <newline> `` The fuck iss an Arbiter ? ! '' <newline> <newline> 'Reproduction is still irrelevant . ' <newline> <newline> `` SSHUT UP ! ! ! ''
Note : I just watched Episode 1 of Season 4 and have n't read any of the books , so I do n't know what happens after that . Please no spoilers ! This is also my first WP post , but constructive feedback is welcome . Also , just for fun I tried to do an unofficial screenplay format , hence the weird capitalization . <newline> <newline> -- - <newline> <newline> Fade in to a mound of swords , tips facing us . We hear footsteps on stone , slowly getting closer . Meanwhile , the camera zooms out until we recognize this as The Iron Throne . Camera sweeps around the throne , until we are in front of middle-aged DAENARYS sitting on the throne , face blank . <newline> <newline> After several seconds , in addition to the footsteps we now also hear the jangle of a maester 's chain . Both sounds then stop , and we hear an aged but familiar voice , `` Your Grace ... '' <newline> <newline> The camera turns to face SAM , in full maester garb . We see him approaching the camera for a few seconds , and then switches to a side view as he stops at the base of the stairs . DAENARYS nods and SAM climbs the first set of stairs towards the throne and stops . <newline> <newline> Looking from behind SAM we see DAENARYS in the throne which towers above her head . To her right stands SIR JORAH , after all these years , he 's still protectively looking over her . The Hand of the King 's medallion hangs from his armor . <newline> <newline> SAM : I 've just received word from The Wall . It 's still holding , but they do n't think it 'll hold much longer . Attacks are growing in frequency and the summer heat slowly melts the ice . <newline> <newline> DAENARYS : What do you advise , Grand Meister ? Can we do anything ? <newline> <newline> SAM : Not yet , but I 've heard rumors of an ancient text which tells of a weapon greater than any the world has ever known . I was reluctant to seek it out because it involves ... <newline> <newline> A look of extreme discomfort crosses his face , almost wincing as he speaks the remaining words . <newline> <newline> SAM : ... blood magic . <newline> <newline> DAENARYS : As protector of the realm , I must do everything in my power to defend my kingdom against the army of White Walkers . You must seek the RED WOMAN at once , perhaps she knows of this text . <newline> <newline> JORAH , disapprovingly : Khaleesi ... <newline> <newline> DAENARYS : I hope to not need it . But if the wall may be breached , we must be prepared . In the meantime , my smiths work tirelessly to make swords and attows of Dragonstone , and convoys arrive weekly at Castle Black with these weapons and reinforcements . And Jorah , you must stop calling me that . I am ... <newline> <newline> She stands , the room quiets and the theme song plays in the background , growing louder until the end of her sentence . <newline> <newline> DAENARYS , thundering : Daenarys Stormborn of House Targaryn , Queen of The Seven Kingdoms , Grandmother of Dragons and Protector of the Realm . <newline> <newline> Still facing her , we hear <newline> <newline> JORAH and SAM ( in unison ) : Yes , my queen . <newline> <newline> Fade into the next scene . <newline> <newline> -- -- <newline> <newline> We see a green , lush , almost idyllic island at dusk . The sea is an unusually bright blue , which would be concerning if we did n't remember it as its namesake , The Sapphire Isle . This is Tarth . <newline> <newline> The camera pans upwards until we see a small group of children playing with wooden swords on a grassy field a ways from the beach . A woman stands in front of them , a sword fighting teacher . The camera continues upwards . We see a small castle , with a balcony over the field . Two figures sit on the balcony , indistinguishable . The camera glimpses a reflection off a golden hand . <newline> <newline> Cut to a closeup of JAMIE and BRIENNE watching the children below . They are both old , in their fifties . We can still make out JAMIE 's unadulterated good looks , and BRIENNE still ... not so much . But she still looks as if she could kill you on a moment 's notice . They occasionally look towards each other and smile as one of the children playfully falls and over-exuberantly feigns injury . <newline> <newline> We hear in the distance , and from JAMIE and BRIENNE 's perspective we see the field and the glowing water behind . <newline> <newline> ARYA : Alright , that 's it for today . And remember , what do we say to Death ? <newline> <newline> CHILDREN ( in unison ) : NOT TODAY ! <newline> <newline> The camera shifts to a closeup of ARYA and follows her movements . <newline> <newline> ARYA : Now inside , it 's getting dark . <newline> <newline> The children drop their swords and run to the castle . ARYA sighs and collects the swords . She walks to a nearby house and throws the swords into a shed . Through the window , we see Needle , framed and mounted on her office wall . How did she end up here , doing this ? She would never know . <newline> <newline> Fade to next scene . <newline> <newline> -- - <newline> <newline> I had to stop here today , but I have an idea for the storyline which I 'd like to write if anyone 's interested in me continuing .
So many times have I walked on ruins , the remainings of places that I loved and got used to.. At first I was scared , each time I could feel my city , my current generation collapse , break into the black hole that thrives within it , I could feel humanity , the way I 'm able to feel my body.. After a few hundred years , the pattern became obvious , no longer the war and damage that would devastate me over and over again in the far past was effecting me so dominantly . <newline> It 's funny , but I felt as if after gaining what I desired so long , what I have lived for my entire life , only then , when I achieved immortality I started truly aging . <newline> <newline> 5 world wars have passed , and now they feel like a simple sickeness that would pass by every so often , I could no longer evaluate the individual human as a being of its own , the importance of mortals is merely the same as the importance of my skin cells ; They are a part of a mechanism so much more advanced , a mechanism that is so dear to my fallen heart a mechanism that I have seen fall and rise so many times , a mechanism that when lost all of which it had , had me loosing my will to live , for the first time in all of my thousands years of existence . <newline> <newline> Acceptance , something so important . a skill that has proved itself worthy dozens of times , an ability that looks so easy to achieve , a gift , that I was n't able to aquire in all my years , until now . When the ashes on the ground flew into the now empty air upon humanity 's fall , I felt as if all of it 's weight was crushing me . Ignorance took over and I searched years for a hope , a sign of the very same patterns that I used to watch reappear every hundred years , the very core of my will to exist that was now no more that I so strongly wish was . <newline> <newline> If you have ever wondered if silence can drive people crazy , it can.. <newline> I ca n't feel my legs , I have walked for days , just to hear the sound of gravel , crushed bones , crushed buildings and crushed civilizations under my steps to keep my sanity.. until I remembered , the day in my far past . The day of my rebirth , I took out of my pocket a small plastic box , with nine buttons and a small glass window . I could n't believe this was our past , I could n't believe how far we have been able to progress and yet , be destroyed by our own violence . <newline> I slowly dialed the number I was given , exactly 1729 years ago . <newline> <newline> I dropped a tear , a tear that was too slow to hit the ground as I got sucked into the darkness that emerged around me . <newline> <newline> A chill went through my spine as I saw my destiny rise above me , I could see the white teeth under the dark cloack ... <newline> <newline> `` You have finally arrived '' He projected into my mind , with the most chilling cold and unhuman voice . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm ready to obey '' I answered . I knew who was sitting infront of me , and it was time for me to obey him , after all these years of playing god , even I came to it . <newline> <newline> Funny is n't it ? Even by achieving immortality , death , is inescapable .
-Week 18 aboard the Depth Reaver , Circa 2023- <newline> <newline> I walk about the dull gray halls , the artificial gravity making my steps feel almost as if they were on land . Almost . I glance out a window as I pass it by . There 's the sun , and there 's the moon right there . And , of course , there 's the Earth . I kinda miss it . Then again , space is pretty cool . It 's got some brilliant views , and the wifi is surprisingly good . Even countless miles away from the Earth , I can crush Silver noobs on CS GO . <newline> <newline> I pass by Dale Malkowitz , the head scientist on board . <newline> <newline> `` Evening , Dale , '' I say . <newline> <newline> `` What up , Danny ? '' he replies cordially . <newline> <newline> `` Nothin ' much . A little bored , I guess . '' <newline> <newline> He shakes his head in disbelief . `` I really , *really* do n't understand how you can be bored in space . '' <newline> <newline> `` Well hey , '' I say slightly defensively , `` Aside from the views , it 's kinda ... dull . And empty . And stuff . '' <newline> <newline> `` Whatever you say , Wittell , '' he says , not unkindly . Then he walks off . A few moments pass , and then I decide to look out the window right by me . As my eyes scan the inky blackness of space ( again ) , I notice something odd about the moon 's surface . It 's slightly ... cracked . <newline> <newline> `` Hey , Malkowitz ? '' I call out , `` You might wan na check this out ! '' <newline> <newline> He walks over to me casually , probably expecting nothing . `` What ? '' he asks , `` What do you see ? '' <newline> <newline> I point at the moon . His brow furrows . `` Huh ... I guess there 's something up with the surface . I 'll have to look into tha- '' <newline> <newline> Suddenly , the surface cracks a little more . We glance at each other , and then back at the moon , and then at each other again , and then back at the moon again . <newline> <newline> `` What 's going on ? '' I ask , alarmed . <newline> <newline> He 's silent for a minute or two , mouth hanging open . Then , he calls out : `` Janice ! Terry ! Johnny ! Get over here ! Something 's up with the moon . '' <newline> <newline> The other crewmates enter , unsure of what to expect . As their eyes lay upon the moon 's surface cracks , they widen . <newline> <newline> And , by coincidence , more cracks appear at that very moment . And then more . And more . And more . And more ... <newline> <newline> Little bits of the moon begin to float away , torn free of the rest of the surface . We all stare , speechless . And then ... it happens . It *happens* . <newline> <newline> The side of the moon facing us is ... torn away by a ... <newline> <newline> Human ... hand ? <newline> <newline> And we see ... <newline> <newline> A giant ... human face ? ! <newline> <newline> Surprisingly , I can hear my thoughts over my racing heart . *I ca n't help but feel as if I recognize that face ... from the ... * <newline> <newline> *Internet . * <newline> <newline> Suddenly , the great face 's lips move . <newline> <newline> Of course , none of us can actually *hear* it speak , because of the laws of space and whatnot . However , I can read its lips , and it appears to be saying : <newline> <newline> `` Are you sure about that ? ''
I was feckin ' sloshed , mate . First time I ever was in the Big Lemon , and I 'd found me the best feckin ' pub I could imagine , I tell ya what . So I stumble out when it was closin ' time , musta been 'round 4 o'clock in the morning , and made my way through some alleys to find the quaint little AirBnB place I 'd rented for the week . <newline> <newline> A'course , that 's how many a horror story starts , ainnit ? But it was all fun and games at first . There was this bloke I saw comin ' towards me in the alley , dark as it was with only a few lights from some apartments overhead , where the folk were still awake . At least , I thought it was a bloke , but he looked more like there was n't something right with the whole alleyway . Like it was a painting someone had gone and ripped with a knife for some reason , fecked-up as it all looked , and the cut looked sort of weird and silvery , and wavy like a heat haze comin ' from a welder 's torch . <newline> <newline> Now this thing must 've been a good foot or five taller 'n me , but sloshed as I am , I just take off my hat and give it a good `` how-do-you-do '' , 'cause I 'm a nice fellow and I wan na pass , y'see ? Now this thing up and goes give me a `` mighty fine , how about y'self , sir ! '' I feckin ' quite pissed my britches ! More in surprise 'n anythin ' , really , but I keep my composure and just sorta try and pass 'm as he walks past me with his long , spindly legs as silvery as the rest of 'm , with his feet makin ' noises like he 's wearin ' cowboy boots with those thingies on 'm . But then that moment stupid old me finds I forgot my lighter at the pub , and so I turn and ask spindleboots there if he 's got some fire for me . <newline> <newline> Darn buggerer turns around on the spot faster 'n my eyes can see and says , he says `` sure ! I got your fire here . '' And the feckin ' thing stretches out one of his spindly legs and wraps it around me like a cobra and pulls me into itself . Devil 's pits , that felt like I was bein ' burnt layer of skin by layer . He sure got me with that . Good feckin ' joke , mate . <newline> <newline> Must 've been out like a light for ages , but when I woke up , I find myself here . So tell me , Doc : are time travellers really that sought after as subjects of study ? 'Cause I know you found me in your fancy cyberwebs database thing and I ca n't be three hundred years old as my passport would say if I had one , but I 'd really like to not die , y'know ? What do y'say , wan na go and grab a beer at the pub ?
“ No , no no no ... ” She backed up and turned the other way the second she saw me heading towards her . <newline> <newline> “ Hey ! ” Starting to walk quickly now I picked up my pace until I nearly ran into her . She tried to duck behind one of the men carrying samples around the food court but instead just managed an awkward half step around him before I grabbed her shoulder . She turned towards me so I could get a clear view of her face . Now I was sure it was her . “ Joanne ? ” Her eyes lit up , if only for a second before she turned back around , grabbed her hands and lowered her head before once again repeating her rant of no ’ s from earlier . <newline> <newline> “ You can ’ t be here , not now . I finally get this far and now you ’ re here. ” She was mumbling more to herself than to me at this point . <newline> <newline> “ You… you ’ re real , ” I said , looking back to her eyes . “ How… do you know who I am ? ” <newline> <newline> “ I ’ m real ? Of course I ’ m real ! But you can ’ t be here ! ” Now she was talking directly to me . “ Do you know what kinds of hell you put me through ? The amount of bullying , stress , and endless therapy ! Dave , I finally get rid of you and now you have to come back in my head and tear it back out from under me , ” she slapped her head a few times as she delivered the last line . <newline> <newline> “ What are you talking about ? I- ” <newline> <newline> “ We were best friends , true or false ? ” She asked . <newline> <newline> “ True , no false , I mean , we were friends but not… ” I looked at her once more to make sure she was actually standing there . “ You ’ re a dream , ” She froze at this . <newline> <newline> “ No , no I ’ m- you ’ re a hallucination . I saw you for years ! Every waking moment from- ” <newline> <newline> “ Seven until twelve ” I looked at her shaking my head , incredulous to what was happening . <newline> <newline> “ When we fell out of that tree that one summer , ” she smiled for just a second before frowning again and looking down . <newline> <newline> “ But that was just a dream , I woke up right after that. ” <newline> <newline> “ No , that actually happened . I was awake , I remember it exactly because that ’ s when I still lived in Australia with my parents. ” I looked at her , and began to realize something . <newline> <newline> “ You saw me when you were awake , I dreamt you while I was asleep . I lived in Boston , when you lived in Australia. ” <newline> <newline> “ Hold on , ” She sat down . “ My head hurts , ” She paused . “ We met , every day- ” <newline> “ Night , ” I corrected . She looked at me and scowled . <newline> <newline> “ Every day . For five years , until we fell . What happened after that ? ” <newline> <newline> “ I told you , I woke up. ” <newline> <newline> “ No , what happened for me ? I don ’ t remember anything but falling head first and then… ” <newline> <newline> “ Joanne , ” I looked her straight in the eyes this time . “ I woke up. ” <newline>
There 's a magical moment between wakefulness and sleep , a moment where noise seems to reach a crescendo but everything is so calm right as you crash into the warm waves of sleep . As my eyes closed the only thing I saw was the time on the TV screen in front of me , faded blue numbers that read 10:34AM . <newline> <newline> Unless your plane explodes . Searing heat tears through flesh and shard of metal pierce every nerve , for a fraction of a fraction of a moment there is nothing but horrendous pain and then there is darkness . <newline> <newline> That 's when I woke up , drenched in sweat , eyes wide with fear and panic . The first thing I noticed was the time . <newline> <newline> 9:35AM <newline> <newline> It had been so real . It was real . That was no dream , it could n't have been ... <newline> <newline> I glance around to my fellow passengers and wonder how it happened . What caused it ? Can we stop it ? Stop the plane , I want to get off ? <newline> <newline> I 've been a cop for a long time , that 's the good news . <newline> <newline> The bad ? <newline> <newline> I 'm stuck in a metal tube that I think is going to explode in less than an hour and I have to find out how without panicking anyone . <newline> <newline> Especially if I 'm wrong . <newline> <newline> But what if I 'm right ? <newline> <newline> No resources , no back-up , no escape . <newline> <newline> Fuck it , no problem . <newline> <newline> ***** <newline> <newline> 9:36AM <newline> <newline> Alright . <newline> <newline> There 's got to be at least 300 people on board , not including crew . It could be mechanical and it 's going up in flames no matter what and that 's bad news . We 're too far away to do anything about that , the map shows somewhere over the Pacific . <newline> <newline> That 's really bad . Not like anyone would believe me . <newline> <newline> I 'm not entirely sure I believe me . <newline> <newline> My only hope is that I can find out what causes the whole thing before the whole thing happens . <newline> <newline> Terrorism ? I mean , I guess it could be but that 's a slim shot in the dark . <newline> <newline> So what in the blue hell blows up a plane over the ocean ? <newline> <newline> First stop ? Bathroom . Experience an explosion is enough to make you feel the urge to ... relieve yourself . <newline> <newline> That 's when I see her . I stand and she 's further back but she 's got that look on her face . The sweat , the panic . She saw it too . <newline> <newline> The good ? I guess I have a partner . <newline> <newline> The bad ? I might not be wrong . <newline> <newline> **** <newline> <newline> 9:37AM <newline> <newline> I wave to her and motion towards the washrooms . <newline> <newline> `` You saw it ? '' <newline> <newline> She nodded . <newline> <newline> `` Did you see anything ? '' <newline> <newline> She shook her head . <newline> <newline> This was n't productive . There had to be something , some piece of information that either of us had buried in our brains that would be useful . Then something clicked . <newline> <newline> `` Do you remember which way the explosion came from ? '' <newline> <newline> She tilted her head as if she was remembering . <newline> <newline> `` Yeah , the heat was in front of me . What the hell is going on ? '' <newline> <newline> I looked back to the passengers . There were six rows between her seat and mine . Six rows of nine , that 's ... 54 if any math from school stuck . <newline> <newline> `` Hey , did you hear me ? '' She said , grabbing my arm . <newline> <newline> `` Yeah ! It came from in front of you . It came from behind me . So that means- '' <newline> <newline> `` It started somewhere between us . '' She finished , which would usually annoy me but in this case it was nice to have someone pick up on it nice and quick . <newline> <newline> I checked my watch . <newline> <newline> 9:41AM . <newline> <newline> We were running out of time . <newline> <newline> **** <newline> <newline> 9:42AM <newline> <newline> `` Does anyone stick out to you ? '' she whispered and I shook my head . We could probably eliminate a few potential suspects by process of elimination . A young family probably was n't going to cause a problem , the elderly couple as well . Stuff like that . <newline> <newline> As I watched I saw there were three people acting nervously . <newline> <newline> One portly man checking his watch a little too frequently . <newline> <newline> A younger man sweating profusely . <newline> <newline> A woman glancing around with what I would describe as suspicion . <newline> <newline> I pointed them out to her and she agreed . So maybe we had three suspects . Or maybe we had three nervous flyers . <newline> <newline> 9:45AM . <newline> <newline> Seconds were ticking by and we had a very limited number of those to start . <newline> <newline> As we stood there a flight attendant approached us from behind . <newline> <newline> She startled both of us and that 's when the woman turned and locked eyes with me . Then her eyes went wide and she knew that someone knew . She bolted from her seat and reached for the overhead compartment . That 's when I slammed into her full force , throwing both our bodies to the hard floor and skidding at least three rows ahead . <newline> <newline> When I lifted my head I was staring down the barrel of a handgun . <newline> <newline> A young man , sweating profusely , was holding the right end of it and I was definitely on the wrong end . <newline> <newline> He was n't holding a badge though . Which meant things were going from bad to worse .
The mountain stood still and large beneath the Warrior . It had not trembled in the days since the people chose him as their Champion . `` Perhaps the Dragon slumbers yet , '' he thought . `` I shall wake him , soon enough . '' He strode forward , heavily , in his iron raiment , shining dully in the morning sun . The shrouded peak drew slowly nearer as the sun climbed the sky , mirroring the Warrior 's toil this day as the last . The Dragon slept silently in its lair amidst the clouds . <newline> <newline> For generations the people had not seen it wake . But their stories , told by night and hearth fire , still remained hushed in reverence of its deadly wrath . Legends told of it waking and the destruction that followed . But that was before . Before the people had tamed iron and bent it to their will . Now they had weapons that could fight the myth . That could quench the fire . <newline> <newline> The Warrior stopped at the edge of the cloud bank , just as the sun had stopped there hours before . He breathed . Deliberately he pulled the heavy iron axe from his belt and gripped it between strong hands . A glow had appeared within the clouds . The mountain rumbled . <newline> <newline> `` I have come to wake you , beast , and I have come to show you the people no longer fear you . '' The ground rolled and thundered . He roared in defiance and raised his axe , charging into the fog . He half ran and climbed in muffled beats as his bloodlust for the Dragon pounded in his ears . The glow grew brighter and the ground shook violently . <newline> <newline> A gout of flame split the clouds in front of the Warrior and he saw his destination . The rock ended in a ridge just above him and the Dragons flames beat and splashed beyond . Without breaking stride , the iron Warrior crested the ridge and leapt , axe raised high , into a pit of Dragon fire .
I open my eyes in a panic , sweat beading and then falling down my face . I look around and the sun in shining through the maroon curtains of my studio apartment . Everything seems to be as I left it the afternoon before , but there is a heavy , unfamiliar air in the room . I notice the throw cover I lazily hang to separate my twin size bed from the rest of the apartment has been ripped to the ground , and that the kitchen faucet rhythmically drips against the cold steel sink . I was alone last night like I always am , I think . No one has been here but me in over three months . <newline> <newline> I 'm not allowed to think about it much longer , as the feeling in my stomach bubbles over and pops once more as it had been doing all night , slowly worsening . I pinch my eyes shut , knowing what 's coming next , and for just one moment , as the pain peaks like a giant wave waiting to break , I think I may just die this time . And just as quickly , the wave reaches the shore , and I know I have a few moments of peace . I open my eyes and look around . I ca n't help but surrender to the weight of them after a few moments , and I drift to an uneasy sleep , as the tension escapes from my stomach and from the rest of my body , dissipating into the small space I call home . <newline> <newline> The next wave takes what remains in me and decimates it . The pain blinds me , numbing me to all feeling and sensation . The relief never comes as I close my eyes involuntarily . <newline> <newline> I finally come to and realize I had been asleep for a while . I open my eyes and , fighting the blinding lights and white room , I see that the natural maroon lighting of my apartment has been replaced by white hospital lights . Beyond the thick glass walls of the room that was smaller than my apartment - though I did n't think it got smaller than that - stand people I have never seen before , looking at papers and analyzing the rhythms of the machines I now realize I am hooked up to . The men all stop and slowly turn their unexpected gazes at me as I begin to curl my sore body into a seated position , only to be shocked back down by a face that made the sea of unfamiliar faces fade away . <newline> <newline> The prominent cheekbones that made my mother seem so much prouder than her nature would actually allow remained strong , though the rest of her seemed to be worn down by the years . The same mahogany curls fell across those cheeks and down right above her shoulders , though they seemed more ashen now . Her frail yet determined hand touching the impenetrable glass and reaching to pick me up and hold me , and I recall the day in my childhood where , in my insistence to become a world champion roller bladder , I fell and scrapped my knee . And I recall the comforted feeling of being cradled in her arms in fetal position . And I recall never wanting to leave the warmth of the embrace . <newline> <newline> And just as I begin to reach out , I crouch and close my eyes to the familiar feeling that boils over in my stomach . Falling in and out of consciousness , I see quick flashes . I see my mother 's crystal blue eyes well with tears that could not be held . I see her strong posture and I see the unfamiliar men gather , bowing and shaking their heads , unsure . I see the green lines of the machines jump and dance . And I see a sign , sloppily and quickly written above my bed , the only writing visible to me in my haze . It read `` Patient Zero '' .
“ Sadie ! I told you not to stand under the tree in the middle of a thunderstorm ! ” <newline> <newline> My mom frantically dialed 911 , as I laid there , shocked . Literally . <newline> <newline> “ Hello ? ! My daughter was just struck- “ <newline> <newline> All of a sudden , something was wrong . I sat up , my fingertips crackling with this new power . Or was it the aftermath of the lighting ? I couldn ’ t tell . Nor did I care . No . Something was definitely wrong , and it was nearby . <newline> <newline> “ If I take 295 south right now , I can get to Home Depot in ten minutes flat . And then I can finally build that deck you ’ ve wanted , they have the planks on sale . I can feel it in my blood . Now , I know , they ’ re plum colored and you did specifically say you wanted pine , but hear me out here . Plum is the pinest color out there , and you ’ d be a birch to say otherwise. ” <newline> <newline> My mom looked back at me , a hint of recognition in her eyes , but the rest of her face read as one emotion : terror . <newline> <newline> “ You know what else ? I ’ m gon na get like , 50 windows from craigslist , they have the best deals , and make a greenhouse ! ” <newline> <newline> Somehow , the words kept spilling out of my mouth . But something else was off here . Something with my house… <newline> <newline> Suddenly , I knew . I felt my blood boiling as I continued to be filled with rage . I jumped up the rest of the way , and dashed the two blocks to my house , where my brother ’ s laptop was . <newline> <newline> “ Not . Home . And his computer is plugged in . ENERGY WASTER ! Doesn ’ t he care about this house ? ! He could ’ ve burned the whole place down ! ” <newline>
I do n't want to cut off his head , but I do n't really have a choice . I close my eyes and just wait for it to be over . My insides turn as I feel the swing connect . <newline> <newline> *Quit being so weak ! You 've done this before . * <newline> <newline> The jock 's girlfriend screams on cue , looks like she is going to faint . She has blonde hair and a blue dress patterned with diamonds . I see how scared she is , and I feel ashamed . I 'm not the bad guy . <newline> <newline> *Do I have to remind you ? Remind you how they came here -- to OUR home -- and ransacked OUR things ? They are trespassing ! * <newline> <newline> The door to the bedroom bursts open , and another girl storms in . I think her name was Whitney . She is holding a shovel . She surveys the scene , and I am impressed by how calm she seems . I decide to back off , but she takes that as a sign to attack . The shovel strikes me in the face , knocking my mask off . Before I can recover , I am hit again . Then a third time . The fourth strike sends me flying out the window . We are currently three stories high . <newline> <newline> *How could you let her do that ? * <newline> <newline> I like the feeling of being weightless . Bits of shattered glass encompass me , sparkling with moonlight . I feel like I 'm floating in space , surrounded by stars . Then I hit the ground and I think I feel a rib break . I shift to make sure . <newline> <newline> *Mother fucker ! * <newline> <newline> Yeah ... it broke . <newline> <newline> I landed in a pile of bushes , which cushioned my fall at least somewhat . Through the thick tangle of branches , I look up toward the broken window . Whitney is nervously peering out of it , scanning the grounds . <newline> <newline> `` He 's gone . '' she shouts before disappearing back into the house . <newline> <newline> *You need to get up . They are getting away . If they get away , they will tell others . More people will come . Not just the shitty teenagers , either . For fuck 's sake , GET UP ! * <newline> <newline> I know I have some time , so I take a moment to collect my thoughts . I do n't like doing this : hurting people . It 's better now that I 'm numb to it . It 's not my fault they keep coming here . It 's not my fault he makes me hurt them . I 'm not the bad guy . <newline> <newline> From the other side of the house , I hear the front door open , followed by the shuffle of feet against gravel . <newline> <newline> `` Keep it together , Cindy . I need you to keep it together '' Whitney 's voice is stern but supportive . <newline> <newline> Though she does n't speak , Cindy 's breathing begins to steady . <newline> <newline> I know they are heading to the car even before I hear the doors open . In the next few seconds , they will drive off , and I can go back to being alone . <newline> <newline> *Except their car wo n't start . You saw to that . * <newline> <newline> The engine begins to hang , and I hear the girls swearing . They keep trying , but it 's no use . <newline> <newline> He makes me stand up and grab my machete even though I do n't want to . He makes me run despite the pain in my side . The girls scream as soon as I round the corner . They throw open their car doors and begin to flee . He tries to make me chase them , but I refuse . <newline> <newline> *If you ca n't do what needs doing , fine . I 'll do it ! * <newline> <newline> I am too weak to fight him . He takes control of me , one limb at a time , and everything fades . <newline> <newline> When I wake up , I am in the woods . It is almost pitch black , but I can make out a tiny cabin in the distance . I start walking toward it , but my foot catches on something , almost knocking me over . I look down to see a limp figure curled into a ball beneath me . She has blonde hair and a blue dress patterned with diamonds . Some of the diamonds are red now . I try not to think about her again as I continue walking . <newline> <newline> As I approach the cabin door , something triggers in the back of my mind . I feel isolated , safe . The door creaks as I push it open and walk inside . <newline> <newline> There are pictures covering the walls , drawings of spaceships and planets and stars . I look closer and find that each picture has something in common : a drawing of a boy with a space helmet . He looks happy . I find something else , too : a photograph . <newline> <newline> This one is of also of a boy , a real one . He is sitting in a wagon with a cardboard box on his head , cut up to look like the same space helmet in the drawings . He is n't alone , though ; there is a man standing behind him . His face has been drawn over in a furious series of pen marks . Though I ca n't see his face , the man terrifies me . He fills me with the same kind of dread I feel every time I hear -- <newline> <newline> A scream comes from behind me , followed by another blow to the head . I stumble around to see Whitney , this time holding a metal baseball bat . She swings at me again , but I catch it in my left hand . Before I can stop it , my right arm shoots forward and strikes her across the face . She flies backward onto an old table , which breaks underneath her . <newline> <newline> *She 's on the ground . It 's time to finish it . * <newline> <newline> I do n't want to . <newline> <newline> *I do n't care what you want , just do what I tell you . * <newline> <newline> No . <newline> <newline> *Do it , you piece of shit . Do it or I will ! * <newline> <newline> NO ! <newline> <newline> I throw my machete toward the ground as his shouts fill the room . The force of it brings me to my knees . Even as I resist , I begin to feel him taking control . My right hand stiffens and begins making its way toward the weapon . Before he can grab it , I kick it away . It skids to a halt right next to Whitney . She picks it up without hesitation and lunges forward . <newline> <newline> It surprises me that I do n't feel pain when the blade enters my chest . Then a scream pierces through my skull and I know it has hurt him instead . I feel my body begin to go limp again , though nothing steps in to take control . <newline> <newline> `` Die ! '' Whitney shouts at me , but I do n't blame her . <newline> <newline> I do n't mind that she does n't understand . I do n't even care if he does . It 's only important that I know it , that I feel it in my bones even as my vision starts to fade . <newline> <newline> I 'm not the bad guy .
For years we had been warned . <newline> Since the 40 's a sparse few had seen the pattern and tried to warn us . <newline> Nutjobs we called them , conspiracy theorists . <newline> <newline> It was supposed to be a day of celebration , the republicans and democrats had been swept away in the election by the newly formed 'unionists ' . <newline> It was at the Swearing-In Ceremony that they chose to strike . <newline> <newline> Close to a million were gathered to witness the ceremony , when our newly elected president 'Dave Johnson ' ripped his facial mask of and revealed his true , reptilian face . <newline> `` Sstupid little monkeyss . We have played you from the sshadowss for decadess . Now , it iss time for uss to take our rightfull place ass your overlordss ! '' <newline> Scream of joy quickly turned to screams of terror as reptilians revealed themselfs everywhere you looked . <newline> Every guard and secret service member present had thrown off their masks and were holding their guns towards the crowd . <newline> `` Do NOT ressisst uss ! We have ruled you pathetic ssociety for yearss ! we have replaced every leader ! We have-.. '' the sentence was cut short by an ear deafening boom . <newline> <newline> `` Anthony , what iss that ? ! what iss going on ? ! ! '' <newline> Dave could only hiss at fellow reptilians as a large alien ship was currently hovering far above them and was sending waves of what appeared to be odd looking silver chariots towards the gathered crowd . <newline> The reptiles , not knowing what to , simply watched along with the crowd as a giant holoscreen appread in the sky . <newline> <newline> The creature that appeared tall , sleek and had grey , almost silverish skin . <newline> 'Organics of Joo'el . We must utilies your planet to halt the Grox advance . This process involves destroying your planet , thus killing you , sorry . ' <newline> `` You have got to be sshitting me ! , I 've only been their ruler for 5 minutess and thiss sshit happenss ! ! '' <newline> <newline> 'Defecation is irrelevant , local warlord . ' <newline> <newline> `` That'ss not what it meanss ! ! '' <newline> Daves scales had gone from green to red during the announcement and it was only getting worse as he continued to yell at the image in the sky . <newline> <newline> `` We sstayed hidden for yearss for thiss to happen ! We wo n't let you take thiss planet when we are on the brink of victory ! You silver spoon ! ! '' <newline> <newline> 'Consent is irrelevant , local warlord . Gobal distribution achived , commencing planetary modifications , please remain calm . ' <newline> <newline> The silver chariots , seemingly ignoring Earths inhabitants , began to spread out and cut into the ground with lightbeams . <newline> Seconds later , an earthquake hit , and something surfaced with it . <newline> Most chariots managed to dodge in time , but those that did n't were smashed by giant constructs emerging from the earth . <newline> The golems were covered in lines emitting the same yellow light that came from their eyes . <newline> At their full height , they were at least 30 storys tall . <newline> Every chariot retreated to a safer distance . <newline> <newline> `` The fuck iss thiss ? ! ! '' <newline> <newline> 'Reproduction is irrelevant , local warlord . ' <newline> <newline> `` SSHUT UP SSILVER TURD ! ! ! '' <newline> <newline> A bellowing voice shook the ground . Forcing those on the ground to cover their ears . <newline> <newline> { We have lain dormant for aeons . We have waited , we have awoken . } <newline> <newline> 'We must utilise this planet to- ' <newline> <newline> `` WE KNOW ! ! ! '' <newline> <newline> { We have waited for- } <newline> <newline> `` I DO N'T CARE ! ! ! '' <newline> <newline> Dave had actually managed to outshout the booming voice from the ground . More than that , anyone near him could see steam rising from his glowing red scales . <newline> <newline> `` We have worked for thiss moument for generationss ! I will not let it be ruined by ssilverware , or dirtpiles , or anything elsse ! ! '' <newline> <newline> Just as Dave had finished , a rift in space above him opened , allowing a small spaceship to pass through before closing . <newline> The spaceship , no bigger than a small car , was hovering 20 feet above Daves scalely head . <newline> <newline> { Oh oh } <newline> <newline> 'Oh no , an Arbiter has arrived . ' <newline> <newline> `` The fuck iss an Arbiter ? ! '' <newline> <newline> 'Reproduction is still irrelevant . ' <newline> <newline> `` SSHUT UP ! ! ! ''
Note : I just watched Episode 1 of Season 4 and have n't read any of the books , so I do n't know what happens after that . Please no spoilers ! This is also my first WP post , but constructive feedback is welcome . Also , just for fun I tried to do an unofficial screenplay format , hence the weird capitalization . <newline> <newline> -- - <newline> <newline> Fade in to a mound of swords , tips facing us . We hear footsteps on stone , slowly getting closer . Meanwhile , the camera zooms out until we recognize this as The Iron Throne . Camera sweeps around the throne , until we are in front of middle-aged DAENARYS sitting on the throne , face blank . <newline> <newline> After several seconds , in addition to the footsteps we now also hear the jangle of a maester 's chain . Both sounds then stop , and we hear an aged but familiar voice , `` Your Grace ... '' <newline> <newline> The camera turns to face SAM , in full maester garb . We see him approaching the camera for a few seconds , and then switches to a side view as he stops at the base of the stairs . DAENARYS nods and SAM climbs the first set of stairs towards the throne and stops . <newline> <newline> Looking from behind SAM we see DAENARYS in the throne which towers above her head . To her right stands SIR JORAH , after all these years , he 's still protectively looking over her . The Hand of the King 's medallion hangs from his armor . <newline> <newline> SAM : I 've just received word from The Wall . It 's still holding , but they do n't think it 'll hold much longer . Attacks are growing in frequency and the summer heat slowly melts the ice . <newline> <newline> DAENARYS : What do you advise , Grand Meister ? Can we do anything ? <newline> <newline> SAM : Not yet , but I 've heard rumors of an ancient text which tells of a weapon greater than any the world has ever known . I was reluctant to seek it out because it involves ... <newline> <newline> A look of extreme discomfort crosses his face , almost wincing as he speaks the remaining words . <newline> <newline> SAM : ... blood magic . <newline> <newline> DAENARYS : As protector of the realm , I must do everything in my power to defend my kingdom against the army of White Walkers . You must seek the RED WOMAN at once , perhaps she knows of this text . <newline> <newline> JORAH , disapprovingly : Khaleesi ... <newline> <newline> DAENARYS : I hope to not need it . But if the wall may be breached , we must be prepared . In the meantime , my smiths work tirelessly to make swords and attows of Dragonstone , and convoys arrive weekly at Castle Black with these weapons and reinforcements . And Jorah , you must stop calling me that . I am ... <newline> <newline> She stands , the room quiets and the theme song plays in the background , growing louder until the end of her sentence . <newline> <newline> DAENARYS , thundering : Daenarys Stormborn of House Targaryn , Queen of The Seven Kingdoms , Grandmother of Dragons and Protector of the Realm . <newline> <newline> Still facing her , we hear <newline> <newline> JORAH and SAM ( in unison ) : Yes , my queen . <newline> <newline> Fade into the next scene . <newline> <newline> -- -- <newline> <newline> We see a green , lush , almost idyllic island at dusk . The sea is an unusually bright blue , which would be concerning if we did n't remember it as its namesake , The Sapphire Isle . This is Tarth . <newline> <newline> The camera pans upwards until we see a small group of children playing with wooden swords on a grassy field a ways from the beach . A woman stands in front of them , a sword fighting teacher . The camera continues upwards . We see a small castle , with a balcony over the field . Two figures sit on the balcony , indistinguishable . The camera glimpses a reflection off a golden hand . <newline> <newline> Cut to a closeup of JAMIE and BRIENNE watching the children below . They are both old , in their fifties . We can still make out JAMIE 's unadulterated good looks , and BRIENNE still ... not so much . But she still looks as if she could kill you on a moment 's notice . They occasionally look towards each other and smile as one of the children playfully falls and over-exuberantly feigns injury . <newline> <newline> We hear in the distance , and from JAMIE and BRIENNE 's perspective we see the field and the glowing water behind . <newline> <newline> ARYA : Alright , that 's it for today . And remember , what do we say to Death ? <newline> <newline> CHILDREN ( in unison ) : NOT TODAY ! <newline> <newline> The camera shifts to a closeup of ARYA and follows her movements . <newline> <newline> ARYA : Now inside , it 's getting dark . <newline> <newline> The children drop their swords and run to the castle . ARYA sighs and collects the swords . She walks to a nearby house and throws the swords into a shed . Through the window , we see Needle , framed and mounted on her office wall . How did she end up here , doing this ? She would never know . <newline> <newline> Fade to next scene . <newline> <newline> -- - <newline> <newline> I had to stop here today , but I have an idea for the storyline which I 'd like to write if anyone 's interested in me continuing .
